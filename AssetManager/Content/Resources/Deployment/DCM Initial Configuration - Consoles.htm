        <h1>DCM: Initial Configuration</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.notes for reviewers" style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;font-style: normal;">Added text from the AM&#160;User Manual to add to the original Deployment Guide (AM&#160;section Configuring and Using Asset Manager)--because my first impression on reading Deployment was that I'd missed something, though it did become clear eventually that this was where I-the-user would first land after installation. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.New text" style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;">After installing <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the first things you need to do are basic configurations. This task is accomplished through the web interface. The five (5) preliminary components that you need to configure are: a Database, a Zone Manager, a Reader, Tag Groups, and a basic License Key.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.notes for reviewers,General.New text" style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;">The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Database and a local Zone Manager will already be configured if you chose the local Zone Manager option and the SQL Server Express options during the installation process. These components will display as configured, and no further action need be taken.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.New text" style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;">When you first log in to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the interface opens to the <b>Admin Console &gt; Dashboard &gt; Configuration</b>. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.notes for reviewers" style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;font-style: normal;">Could just go from that sentence above into consoles, but it's worth considering outlining the decisions that must be made, all in one place <b>before</b> talking about how to set up the system to register them. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.notes for reviewers" style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal;">(Note also that Tag groups appear after some other elements in the TOC from Deployment and in the Getting Started video, but not the UI.)</p>

        <h2>Consoles</h2>
        <p>There are two primary views (consoles) in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, accessible at any time:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Admin Console: Access this console by clicking the <b>Admin Console</b> link in the lower right corner of the web interface of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This console is typically used for administrative functions of the server and where a large portion of this document focuses. It could be considered the "Control <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-04-20T14:27:58.9080998-05:00" MadCap:creator="DSFoxx" MadCap:initials="DS" MadCap:comment="deleted quotes where bold-for-click formatting was appropriate, but this is metaphor..." MadCap:editor="DSFoxx" MadCap:editDate="2015-04-20T14:28:20.4463317-05:00">Panel"</MadCap:annotation> of your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This is where most of the initial configuration is done.</li>
            <li>User Console: Access this console by clicking the <b>User Console</b> link in the lower right corner of the web interface of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This console is for managing and viewing sensors, alerts, dashboards, reports, graphs, etc. This is where the final configuration and daily use of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is done.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NOTE: Switching between the two consoles is done by clicking either the Admin Console or the User Console link at the bottom right of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user interface. The two links toggle depending on which console you are using.</p>
        <p>The following sections describe how to configure the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> settings necessary for a pilot deployment. Additional sections later in this document will describe how to use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for a full roll-out and for general use. For further reference, the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Administration and Usage Manual and many other technical documents are available online at <a href="http://support.rfcode.com/">http://Support.RFCode.com</a>.</p>
