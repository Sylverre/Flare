        <p MadCap:conditions="General.notes for reviewers" style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Both too much and too little info in the AM&#160;Reference, and nothing perfectly on-point in Deployment, so here's a new placeholder. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Source text">Zone Manager is a real-time location engine designed specifically for use with RF Code’s asset management and wire-free environmental monitoring solutions. Zone Manager handles all of the direct hardware interfaces for RF Code readers and tags. Zone Manager is essentially the engine under the hood of Asset Manager and was designed for easy integration with one or more business applications via its open application programming interface (API).</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="General.New text" style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;">Default settings for a single Zone Manager are applied during Deployment unless otherwise specified. &#160;At any time, settings can be changed here. Additional Zone Managers can be added. </p>
