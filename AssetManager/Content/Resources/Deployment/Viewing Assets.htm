        <h1>Viewing Assets</h1>
        <p>After an Asset is added successfully, you can view its status, readings, and other data.</p>
        <p>To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <b>User Console &gt; Assets &gt; Manage Assets</b>.</li>
            <li>In this view, select Environmental View from the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner of the window (under the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> logo).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Attributes specific to Temperature – Humidity (or other environmental) sensors are then displayed as separate columns with rows displaying sensor readings by each sensor tag.</p>
        <p>NOTE: If you double-click the name of any rack, then you can drill into the details of the sensors associated with that rack. You can see, for example, the temperature readings of each of the three sensor tags on that rack as well as the computed RCI-HO and RCI-LO metrics for that rack.</p>
