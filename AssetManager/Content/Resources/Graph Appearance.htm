        <p>This section allows you to:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Choose the size of the Graph</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Choose a background color for the Graph (defaults to white)</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Choose the line thickness of the Graph </li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Group axis values by unit</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Display a grid on the Graph</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Specify the location of the Graph legend</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_10">To configure the appearance of a graph, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_4">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_2">Choose whether or not to group the Y-axis of the graph by the unit type of the displayed attributes. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ColorfulListAccent11_16">
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; If this box is not checked and two or more attributes are chosen, then each of the attributes will be given its own Y-axis. For example, since the reader noise attribute for channel A on a reader is a different attribute than for channel B, then two Y-axis will be produced, each with its own minimum and maximum values and the result may be that the point produced for the value of "-80" for Channel A might be at a different place than the point produced for the same value for Channel B.&#160; Since both of these attributes share the same attribute unit type, you can correct this problem by choosing to "Group Axis by Unit". By doing this, only one Y-axis will be produced that will represent both of the reader channels and all the points will line up correctly when compared to each other.<br /></p>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_4">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">After you choose the graph configuration settings, click the <span class="Strong">Save Changes </span>button at the bottom of the editor screen to save the graph. <br />At this point the graph is defined, created and ready to run.<br /><br /><span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; You can make a copy of a graph so that other users can quickly build a new graph based on an existing graph. To do this, click the <span class="Strong">Copy </span>button.</li>
