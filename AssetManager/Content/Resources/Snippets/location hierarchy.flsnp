    <body>A location hierarchy is a top-down grouping of your locations, beginning with a large single category that contains all the others and then moving down, as from Country (US) to State (TX) to City (Austin, Dallas, Houston). Items within a level are peers; items one item up or down are said to be parents or children. The Location Hierarchy is unpopulated upon installation except for the top-level <span class="ital">Location</span> and an <span class="ital">Unknown Location</span>. </body>
