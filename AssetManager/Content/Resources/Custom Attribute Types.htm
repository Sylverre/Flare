        <p class="p_49" MadCap:conditions="General.notes for reviewers" style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Custom Attributes <i>are</i> used in DCM! Rack Visualization uses mount types, sensor profiles, etc. Play around with these, and ask whether bundled as imports, pre-installed, etc. Source text from AM should not be used even as a jumping-off place, except perhaps for organization. </p>
        <p class="p_49" MadCap:conditions="General.Source text">Custom Attribute Types can be organized in a simple (flat) group or in a hierarchical structure just like standard Asset Types. However, creating and using Custom Attribute Types requires forethought and planning to fully and correctly implement because it’s almost always necessary to create other objects within the schema to use with them, e.g., new Asset Attributes.&#160; It’s also necessary to associate the new Types and Attributes properly to each other as well as to your Assets.&#160; Therefore, configuring Custom Attribute Types is an advanced topic that is not covered in full detail in this manual. Most of the structures and relationships within your data schema can be accomplished by using standard Asset Types and Asset Attributes. Custom Attribute Types are only required for very specific situations. </p>
