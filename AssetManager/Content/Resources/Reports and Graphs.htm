        <p>In the Admin Console, the Reports/Graphs task lets you produce tabular and summary Reports about Readers, Zone Managers and Users that are established and managed by Asset Manager. Tabular reports are simply reports in spreadsheet format with columns of attributes and rows of data, while summary reports are counts and simple aggregates of data, such as the number of server assets or the average daily temperature in a given location.&#160; In addition to reports, you can also create graphical representations (Graphs) of reader states, reader noise levels, Zone Managers states, asset conditions, and environmental conditions. In the User Console, assets being managed and monitored by the system can be graphed and reported on.&#160; </p>
