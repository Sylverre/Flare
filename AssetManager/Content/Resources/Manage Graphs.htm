        <p>Creating Graph definitions is done through the Manage Graphs menu, which lets you&#160; <span class="span_5">specify</span> what will be graphed and how. Asset Manager provides some standard graph templates to help you create graphs, but you can also create completely customized Graphs.</p>
        <p>Configuring Graph definitions is essentially the same in both the Admin Console and in the User Console, with the exception that configuring Graph definitions in the User Console offers an additional Security configuration option that lets the Graph creator define an Execution User Account.&#160; Otherwise, the configuration fields are the same for both, although the Attribute options for Filters, Conditions, and Columns differ depending upon what type of Graph is chosen.</p>
        <p>Graphs in Asset Manager are produced in a linear style with the axis determined by the criteria you specify.</p>
