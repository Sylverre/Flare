        <p class="p_10">The administrator has the ability to control the behavior of how the Location field displays its value.&#160; This behavior is controlled in the Admin Console from the <span class="Strong">Configuration</span> task under <span class="Strong">Server</span>.</p>

        <p>You can have Asset Manager display an <span class="span_13">Unknown Location</span> value for Location based on three possible conditions:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_18">
                <span class="Strong">Never</span> – to maintain the assigned location even if the asset is offline or its location cannot be determined based on location rules</li>
            <li class="li_18">
                <span class="Strong">No matching location rules</span> – to display Unknown Location when an asset’s location cannot be determined by any location rules in the system</li>
            <li class="li_19">
                <span class="Strong">Asset is offline or no matching location rules</span> – to display Unknown Location when&#160; the asset goes offline or when an asset’s location cannot be determined by any location rules in the system</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_43">&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; For greater precision in locating and determining the location of assets, RF Code provides IR location hardware with line-of-sight precision in order to add a further layer, or measure, of confidence when determining the location of an asset. </p>
