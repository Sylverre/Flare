            </a>Creating and Using Map Hot Spots</h3>
        <p>After creating a map, one of the first features to explore is Hot Spots, so you can, for example, create a click-through path to another map.&#160; </p>
        <p>At the top of the Map Editing screen is the <span class="Strong">Hot Spot Tools</span> control panel.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../RFC-AM Comprehensive/Content/Resources/Images/UserManual for reference/030000BE.png" style="height: 60px;width: 491px;" class="img_2" />
        </p>
        <p>Use the second icon from the left to create a rectangular hot spot.&#160; </p>
        <p>If you want to create a multi-dimensional hot spot (i.e., one that is not rectangular), then click the third icon from the left (the one immediately to the right of the square/rectangle).&#160; </p>
        <p>Although maps are generally separates by function, i.e. one map might show showing sensor readings/summaries and another might show a geographical click-through based on larger to smaller geographical area, you can include both types on the same map.&#160; </p>
        <p class="p_10">In the example below, one hot spot points to a Rack Location (one specific rack in a row of racks), which then drills down to another map that show individual temperature sensors, each of which represented by its own hot spot on the destination map.&#160; Notice the circled hot spot and its respective settings (highlighted in yellow) in the lower left frame.&#160; <br /><br /><img src="../../../RFC-AM Comprehensive/Content/Resources/Images/UserManual for reference/030000BF.png" style="height: 516px;width: 621px;" class="img_2" /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_10">In this next example, a Hot Spot has been created for a different rack, but instead of allowing a click through to the individual rack location, this Hot Spot shows the average intake temperature of the rack as a whole.&#160; This is done by pointing to the Summary Asset for the rack because, by default, the Summary Asset provides an aggregate of all sensor readings associated with the rack.&#160; </p>
        <p class="p_10">

        </p>
        <p class="p_10">After the map is saved, switch over to the <span class="Strong">User Console</span> and navigate to <span class="Strong">Maps</span>.</p>
        <p>Navigate to the desired map using the <span class="Strong">Location</span> pull-down menu.&#160; Within that location, you can choose a specific map from the <span class="Strong">Map</span> pull-down menu.&#160; The other options available to you allow you to change the View, Attribute, and/or Attribute Formatting. For more information about conditional formatting based on Attributes, refer to the Attribute Formatting section.</p>
        <p>Hovering over the respective hot spots in the map view will reveal additional information about the hot spot target (e.g., environmental conditions for a rack).&#160; This can be turned off and/or modified in the “View” configuration of the map.&#160; </p>
