            </a>Manage Reports</h1>
        <p>The Manage Reports task lets you create Report definitions based on specific criteria. Asset Manager provides several predefined reports you can use and customize.  In addition, you can create Consolidated Reports which let you run multiple reports simultaneously so that they can be viewed or exported as a group.</p>
        <p>The following System Reports are available in the Admin Console:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consolidated System Report</li>
            <li>Reader Custom Report</li>
            <li>Reader Noise Report</li>
            <li>Reader Offline Report</li>
            <li>Reader Online Report</li>
            <li>System Alert Report</li>
            <li>User Access Report</li>
            <li>Zone Manager Custom Report</li>
            <li>Zone Manager Offline Report</li>
            <li>Zone Manager Online Report</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Report definitions can be run at any time or they can be scheduled either to run once or according to a defined schedule at specific days and/or times in the future.</p>

        <p>To run a report and view it immediately, use the <span class="Strong">Manage Reports</span> task and choose the report from the list of report definitions.&#160; Once selected, click the Run Report button at the top of the page.&#160; The report will begin to execute and you can navigate to the Reports task to view its progress and see the results once it is complete.&#160;&#160; Optionally, you can click the <span class="Strong">Run and View Report</span> button to run the report and view the results of it on-screen without navigating away from the Manage Reports task.</p>
        <p>Reports in Asset Manager are created in a tabular style that produces a table output of multiple rows and columns based on the report criteria specified.</p>
