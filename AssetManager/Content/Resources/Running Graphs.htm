            <span class="span_12">&#160;</span>Running Graphs</h3>
        <p>Graphs are shown in a table of available graph outputs.&#160; Graphs are categorized in the graph table by <span class="Strong">Name</span>, <span class="Strong">Job Start Time</span>,<span class="Strong"> Job Stop Time</span>, and<span class="Strong"> Graph Status</span>. </p>
        <p>The Name column is self-explanatory. The Start Time and Stop Time values for a Graph define the temporal boundaries for the data displayed in the Graph, e.g., reader noise readings for a time range of a week starting at midnight (12AM) on a Monday morning and ending at 11:59PM on the following Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Graph Status column lets you know if the Graph job has finished and if not, why not.&#160; Graph Status values are:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Complete</span> – This indicates that the Graph job is complete and ready to be viewed or exported.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Queued</span> – This indicates that the Graph job is in the queue waiting to be run.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Running</span> – This indicates that the Graph job is currently running.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Failure</span> – This indicates that the Graph job failed due to an internal error.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_42">To view a graph, select the appropriate graph from the list and then click the <span class="Strong">View </span>button. <br />A window will appear displaying the graph in PNG format, such as the one below.<br /><br /><img src="../../../RFC-AM Comprehensive/Content/Resources/Images/UserManual for reference/030000B5.png" style="height: 163px;width: 623px;" class="img_2" /></p>
