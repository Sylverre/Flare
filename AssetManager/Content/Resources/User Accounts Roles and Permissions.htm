        <p>Asset Manager enables the designation of six User Roles: Asset Editor, Asset Manager, Asset Reporter, Asset Reporter with Events &amp; Alerts, Asset Viewer, and System Administrator. The six Roles have different levels of access to different features and functions within Asset Manager. The base parameter of security configuration is the assignment of a Role to a User. This can be done when a User account is created or at any point in the future by editing a User account. The following are brief descriptions of the six User Roles and the level of access for each, presented in order of least access to most access within Asset Manager:</p>
