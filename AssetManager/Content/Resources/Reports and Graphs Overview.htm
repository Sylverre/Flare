            <span>&#160;</span>Reports and Graphs Overview</h2>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Reports/Graphs</span> task provides the following six sub-tasks (configuration areas):</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_32">
                <span class="Strong">Manage Reports</span>: This configuration area lets you create report criteria and then run reports either manually or based on a schedule you have defined. Once a report is created and executed, the result of the report is available on the Reports sub-task. </li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_32">
                <span class="Strong">Reports</span>: This configuration area <span class="span_2">lets you view the progress of reports that are running and access the data of reports that are complete.&#160; These reports may have been executed by a user or might have run based on a configured schedule.</span>&#160; The results of <span class="span_2">completed reports</span> can be viewed immediately or exported to XML, CSV, PDF, or SQLite formats.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_32">
                <span class="Strong">Manage Graphs</span>: This configuration area allows administrators to create graph criteria and to run graphs. Once a graph is created and executed, the result of the graph is available on the Graphs sub-task. </li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_32">
                <span class="Strong">Graphs</span>: This configuration area <span class="span_2">lets you view the progress of graphs that are running and access the data of graphs that are complete.&#160; These graphs may have been executed by a user or might have run based on a configured schedule. </span> The <span class="span_2">completed graphs</span> can be viewed immediately or exported to a PNG format.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_32">
                <span class="Strong">Actions</span>: This configuration area allow the user to deliver a report or graph to one or more recipients when the report or graph is run either on a schedule or interactively from the user interface. <span class="span_2">You can select from three protocols when creating Actions: </span>Email, HTTP Post, and FTP.&#160; <span class="span_2">Once an action is defined, it can be assigned to a report in the “Manage Reports” section mentioned above.&#160; Any number of actions can be assigned to an individual report</span><span class="span_2"> and any number of reports can share the same Actions.</span></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_20">
                <span class="Strong">BIRT Templates</span>: Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT™) is an open-source report generation tool developed by the Eclipse™ Foundation. You can create reports in the BIRT Designer and then add them to Asset Manager where the report will be executed. The BIRT module enables a rich variety of features, such as custom formatting, charts, data grouping and logos. You can even include data from <span class="span_2">multiple reports and external data sources</span> to create reports tailored to your specific needs. </li>
        </ul>
