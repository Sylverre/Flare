        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Rack-level monitoring is not required in all areas. For network closets, you may need only room-level temperature and humidity sensors and a door tag. </p>
        <p>For best read range, mount sensor tags at least five feet from the floor and so they are not shrouded by metal, i.e., do not install sensor tags inside equipment racks, such as half-way from front to back or on enterprise computing equipment within the racks.</p>
        <p>An example minimal server room deployment is shown below:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>R155 Temperature-Humidity tags (A) are on the outside of equipment racks to monitor equipment intake and exhaust air.</li>
            <li>The R150 Temperature Tag (B) is placed to measure AC supply temperature.</li>
            <li>The R120 Door Tag (C) is mounted on the inside of the room entrance door to monitor unauthorized room access.</li>
            <li>The reader (D) is mounted on the cable tray between the racks being monitored.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Install one R155 Temperature-Humidity Tag on the front side and one on the rear side of the equipment rack, or one sensor each on the front of rack containing critical equipment. If the racks have mesh doors, install the tag on the outside of the rack door. If the racks do not have doors (e.g., open racks or two-post racks), affix the tag anywhere near the IT equipment about five (5) feet above the floor. Affix the tags using the adhesive pads or the zip-ties and the lanyard mounts included in the bundle.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; "> Do not affix the sensor tags to the IT equipment directly.</p>
        <p>Install one R150 Temperature Tag near the AC supply for the room, preferably in the air stream, or mount it in another area of the room where you want to monitor ambient air temperature.</p>
