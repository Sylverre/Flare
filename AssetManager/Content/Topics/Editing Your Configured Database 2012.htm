        <h1>Editing Your Configured Database </h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> requires a database to function. All configuration and information is stored in this database. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> requires access to a database with full read/write privileges. If you are using a remote database, then the database administrator must create the database and create a userid/password that has full access to the database. If you are using a local copy of Microsoft SQL Server Express, the steps mentioned below should have automatically been configured at installation time.</p>
        <h3>Editing Your Configured Database</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the Configuration&gt;Database to access the database configuration that you created in the Getting Started steps.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Database Type:</span> Type of database that you will be using with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. You have a choice of either Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle 11g Server, or IBM DB2 Server.</li>

            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Port:</span> The port number you will use to connect to your database. In most cases the default value for connecting to Microsfot SQL Server will be port number 1433 (PostgreSQL = 5432, Oracle 11g = 1521, IBM DB2 = 50000). If you are unsure of your port number, contact your database administrator.</li>
