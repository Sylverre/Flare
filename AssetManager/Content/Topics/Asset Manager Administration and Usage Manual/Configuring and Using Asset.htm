        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541328"></a>Configuring <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p>Five basic components must be configured in order to use <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />: a database, a Zone Manager, a <a href="Adding and Configuring Readers.htm">Reader</a>, <a href="Adding Tag Groups.htm">Tag Groups</a>, and a basic <a href="Adding Licenses.htm">License Key</a>. These are shown in the Dashboard under System Status in the System Configuration task pane.&#160; Until you configure each of the five basic System Configuration components, there will be a red <img src="../../Images/redx.bmp" /> next to each. The red <img src="../../Images/redx.bmp" /> will change to a green checkmark <img src="../../Images/greencheck.bmp" /> after you complete the initial configuration for that component.&#160; <br /></p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> Database and a local Zone Manager will already be configured if you chose the local Zone Manager option and provided database details (or, for a pilot deployment, chose the SQL Server Express option) during the installation process. These components will appear with green checkmarks next to them in the Configured column.</p>

        <p>Double-click a component name from System Configuration or click the Configuration task <img src="../../Images/Configuration gear.bmp" /> to access a configuration task pane. Readers, Tag Groups, and License keys must be configured in the system before it can be used. There is no required order for these configuration tasks. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.SourceText">The instructions for configuring these primary system components are found in the sections that immediately follow this one; however, this section provides an overview of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> web interface in order to help you understand the structure of the web interface application and to help you navigate within it.</p>
