        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541378"></a>Calculated Asset Attributes Overview</h1>
        <p>Calculated Asset Attributes can be used in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> in the same way as standard asset and status attributes. They can be used with Reports, Graphs, and Alerts and also can be viewed immediately on-screen. The following types of calculated asset attributes are supported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boolean </li>
            <li>Custom Type Reference</li>
            <li>Date</li>
            <li>Enum</li>
            <li>Floating Point</li>
            <li>Integer</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Time and Date<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Calculated Attribute Formula must be created in order to configure a Calculated Asset Attribute. The following are components of a Calculated Attribute Formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Functions:</span> These are built-in functions that are part of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> software that are used to compute the calculated fields.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Attributes:</span> These are the system or asset attributes which will be used to calculate the Calculated Asset Attribute.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Standard Mathematical Operators:</span> These are the various operators that will be used within the formula such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, etc.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Scope:</span> This is the field of reference or view of the calculated attribute. For example, local scope or location scope.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Time References:</span> These are the time specifications that will be used in the Calculated Asset Attribute. <br /><br />Example: <span class="codefont">[ ASSET_COST * .25 ]</span> <br /><br />The formula above produces a result which is 25% of the cost of the asset.<br /></li>
        </ul>
