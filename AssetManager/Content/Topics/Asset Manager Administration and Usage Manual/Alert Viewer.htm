        <p>The Alert Viewer is accessible as the first sub-task under Alert Management.&#160; However, the Alert Viewer will not be populated until you have configured one or more Alert Actions based on at least one or more Thresholds.&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>This sub-task lets you view and manage alerts. When alert conditions are processed by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, the alert details can be viewed by using this sub-task. </p>
        <p>Alerts can be filtered using the Filter Bar. Alerts can be filtered by Type, Location, Status (Open, Closed), Attribute, Operator, Value.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Alert Viewer provides the following controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Pause/Resume Update: </span>By default, the Alert View will be continually updated in the browser. Use the Pause button to stop the alert view from updating. This is especially useful when there is a high-volume of alerts. Click Resume to enable real-time updates.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">View: </span>Click the View button to view the details of a selected alert.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Acknowledge: </span>Click the Acknowledge button to acknowledge a selected alert. This option is only available for thresholds that have been configured with the “User Required to Acknowledge Alert” check box in the Alert Threshold sub-task.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Delete: </span>Click to delete the alert from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> database.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Delete All Closed: </span>Clicking this button will delete all alerts that have been closed from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> database.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notification of system alerts also happens in the Alert field at the bottom of both the Admin Console and the User Console in the middle area between the Current User and the Logout link.&#160; The most recent alert and the number of open alerts will be visible in red.</p>
        <p>

            <br /> </p>
        <p>You can then view these alerts in the Alert Viewer by navigating to it from the left pane of Tasks or by clicking on either the name of the most recent alert or on the notification of how many alerts there are open. </p>
        <p>When you click the link, the Alert Viewer opens and shows details for all of the Open Alerts.</p>
