        <h1><a name="_Locations_and_Rules"></a><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541358"></a>Add a Rule to a Location</h1>
        <p>Assigning rules to locations can help to fine-tune the interpretation of tag location through the specification of reader channel SSI thresholds or through the use of IR Codes (if you use IR tags and Room Locators or Rack Locators).</p>
        <h2>To add a Rule to a Location:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a Location from the Location Hierarchy.<br /></li>
            <li>Click the <span class="Strong">New Rule</span> button.<br /></li>
            <li>From the drop-down list, select the type of rule you would like to add.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><a href="Rule Types and Configuration.htm">Rule Types and Configurations</a> are defined in the table below.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">When the Match by IR Locator Rule is selected, a field titled Zone Manager will appear in the Rule Configuration box. The administrator is now able to specify which particular Zone Manager the rule applies to. This allows the administrator to duplicate IR Locator Numbers for different Zone Managers and causes the selected rule to be only applied when the specific IR Location Number is seen on the specified Zone Manager. The administrator will be able to choose from any of the Zone Managers that have been configured.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">IR-based rules overrule SSI rules; a rule based on signal strength indicators (SSI) will not be able to pull an asset out of an IR-defined Location.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Fill in the required fields and click <span class="Strong">Save Changes</span>. <br />The rule appears in the Locations &amp; Rules tree under the specified location.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Channels of a reader appear in the left panel only when a reader’s Zone Manager (configured in Reader Configuration) is <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-02T16:13:16.0195501-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="Alert user question: why are there two channels?
