        </p>
        <p>The Graph Search Filters let you search by Type (as defined and named in Manage Graphs), by the Time the Graph was created, and by the Date or Date Range of the information presented in the Graph.</p>
        <p>To run a graph, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the appropriate graph from the list of graphs and then click on the <span class="Strong">Run Graph </span>or the <span class="Strong">Run and View Graph </span>button. <br />A window will appear prompting you to name the output of the graph.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            <br />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>By default a name is provided which is the name of the graph in addition to the day, date and time of the run. Use the supplied name or edit the name and then click <span class="Strong">OK </span>to run the graph. All outputs of graphs that are run are available on the Graphs sub-task.</li>
            <li>If the <span class="Strong">Run and View Graph </span>button is selected, the Graph for the report selected will be displayed in <span class="Strong">PNG </span>format.</li>
