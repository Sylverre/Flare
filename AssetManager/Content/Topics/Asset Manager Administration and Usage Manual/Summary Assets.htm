        <p>In order to understand Summary Assets, you need to understand the two parts of the system that are associated when you use Summary Assets: Location objects (Locations) and Asset objects (Assets). In the simplest definition, Locations are places while Assets are objects such as inventory items or environmental sensors.&#160; A Summary Asset is an asset that is also a location. </p>
        <p>A Summary Asset is essentially an association between a location and an asset.&#160; By associating locations and assets, you can obtain information about all of the assets and the attributes of those assets at any particular location, whether the location “contains” one or many assets.&#160; A useful function of this association is to use Calculated Attributes to obtain aggregate information about a collection of assets.&#160; This information can be as simple as a count of all the assets in a location, for example, all of the servers in a particular data center row, or it can be an industry-standard metric, for example, the Rack Cooling Index (RCI) derived from all of the temperature sensors on all of the racks for a given row of racks or for an entire data center. In addition, these calculated attributes can be used on maps, in reports, to generate alerts, etc., just like any other attribute.</p>
        <p>Defining Summary Assets is done by using the “Location to Asset Association” sub-task under Locations/Rules/Maps in the Administrator Console. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">An Asset is an item that can be tagged and managed or monitored.A Location in the Location Hierarchy represents a physical place, and can be considered a container: a city contains many campuses, a campus contains buildings, and so on.
