            The Statistical Computation Engine is license-key-enabled functionality that adds  the ability to produce statistical data on a scheduled basis utilizing a selectable data range. The statistical computations supported are Maximum, Minimum, Median, Average, and Standard Deviation. The outputs from the Statistical Computation Engine are stored as Asset Attributes that can be utilized throughout <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> (in live grid views, dashboards, graphs, reports, and so forth). </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">A Statistical Pack is a grouping of statistical data from a selected data range that is computed on a scheduled basis. The statistical computations supported are Maximum, Minimum, Median, Average, and Standard Deviation. Outputs from this computation are handled as Asset Attributes, and can be utilized throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />; for example, added to graphs, reports, dashboards, and map views.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Statistical Packs define source attributes, statistics to be computed, computation frequency, historical data window, and the target attribute that will store the computed statistic. Statistical Policies define the target asset types with which Statistical Packs can be associated or applied. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Similarly, create other statistical attributes for Daily Minimum Temperature, Daily Average Temperature, Daily Median Temperature, and Daily Standard Deviation. These new attributes must then be associated with an asset type. Navigate to <span class="strong">Administrator console &gt; Asset Types</span> and choose the appropriate Asset Type. In this example, you would choose Asset &gt; Sensor &gt; Temperature-Humidity. Then you would click on the <span class="strong">Add</span> button to add the newly created attributes.</p>
