        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541319"></a><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Software and Hardware Overview</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> provides a comprehensive asset <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-26T11:36:11.7281117-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="AM should not be pitched for data centers!" MadCap:editor="Pappillon" MadCap:editDate="2015-06-26T13:09:36.7444440-05:00">management</MadCap:annotation> and environmental monitoring system that provides a front-end user interface to configure and monitor <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> active RFID tag and reader solutions, which are deployed across a wide variety of business infrastructures.&#160; The end-to-end system builds up from the hardware layer of tags, which send message beacons to RFID readers, which relay the information to Zone Manager, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> middleware application, which then passes the information on to the top-level server, which is then accessed by end-users through a web interface launched in a standard web browser. </p>

        </p>
        <p>While potentially complex, the basic system is easy to use and maintain after the hardware has been deployed and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> has been initially configured.</p>
        <h2><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541320"></a><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Readers</h2>
        <p>
            <br /><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> readers do not use high-powered radio or magnetic fields to energize or trigger the RFID tags. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> readers are passive, incidental emitters with dual-channel radio receivers that are tuned to receive signals at 433.92 MHz. A digital signal processor is used to monitor the radio messages received from the tags.</p>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"></MadCap:variable> RFID&#160;Tags</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> systems operate at 433.92 MHz; the tags are one-way, transmit-only communicators. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> holds numerous FCC grants for transmitters (tags). RFC’s patented communication protocols were designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference. Tags typically broadcast their status every 10 seconds, but because each message is so short, each tag has an actual transmission time of less than 10 seconds per day.</p>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> IR&#160;Locators</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">An IR&#160;Locator is an identity beacon that transmits a unique user-defined code. IR-enabled tags receiving this beacon provide that information to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, thus signaling the tagged asset’s proximity to the locator. Rack, Room, and Proximity Locators are commonly used. </p>
