        <h1>The System Properties File</h1>
        <p>The system.properties file contains configuration directives for the software that may not be set inside the database or may be needed in order to connect to the database when the service is started. Changes made to this file are preserved when <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> is upgraded. The file is modified whenever database connection parameters are changed within the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> software. Additionally, directives can be modified and added by hand that will change the behavior of the software.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Save a copy of the system.properties file to an external location before editing. Except as instructed, do not edit the system.properties file without first contacting <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support.  </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> recommends including the system.properties file in the regular backup regimen of the system. All other unique information for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> other than what is contained in this file is stored in the database. The system.properties file and the database backup comprise the required pieces to restore the system.  </p>
