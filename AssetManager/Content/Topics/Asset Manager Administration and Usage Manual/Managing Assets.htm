        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541339"></a>Managing Assets</h1>
        <p>In order to efficiently and effectively manage your assets and monitor your environment within <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />; you will need to plan and define a location hierarchy in which your assets exist.&#160; Before deploying <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> in your production environment, you will need to have a good understanding of the logical Locations that are used in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />; however, you can use the pre-defined location hierarchy when you add the first few assets to the system while you are learning how to use it.</p>
        <p>Locations are described in detail in the <a href="Locations and the Location.htm#_Locations_and_the">Location and Location Hierarchy</a> section.</p>
        <p>In addition to needing a properly structured Location Hierarchy, you will also want to extend the schema that is initially available within <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />.&#160; The schema is the collection of Asset Types, Asset Attributes, Calculated Attributes, and Custom Attribute Types. Upon initial installation (that is, “out of the box”), <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> has only a limited number of these available for you to use when adding assets to the system.&#160; However, there are two “stock” schemas available for immediate import and use in order to give you more pre-defined choices for categorizing and working with you assets and sensors.&#160; These two default asset schemas and all of the assets and asset attributes are discussed in detailed in the <a href="Default Asset Schemas.htm#_Default_Asset_Schemas">Default Asset Schemas</a> section in the Appendix.</p>
        <p>Prior to importing one of the default asset schemas or creating any new Asset Types, the Asset Type Hierarchy will appear with limited choices; therefore, you will need to import a schema or manually create the specific Asset Types that you need for your production environment prior to adding new Assets. The base schema, immediately available after installing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, contains no specific Inventory assets, such as Server, Storage Device, Laptop, etc. It contains three top-level categories (Inventory, Sensor, and/or Summary – Location) and eleven second-level or sub-type Asset Types that represent the standard types of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> sensors.</p>
