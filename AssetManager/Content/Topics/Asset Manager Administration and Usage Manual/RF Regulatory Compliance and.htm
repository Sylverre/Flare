        <p>Transmission power is strictly regulated by governments to ensure that IT devices can coexist with RFID systems. Part 1 of the US FCC Part 15 mandates that a certified wireless device may not cause harmful interference. Moreover, most IT equipment is enclosed in a metal casing that is RF-opaque to UHF transmissions at 433 MHz. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> tag transmissions do not penetrate the metal casings of typical IT equipment.
            <br /><br /><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> systems do not have any negative effect on IT equipment in a data center or in similar environments like telecommunications centers. Over two million <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> tags have been deployed in the past decade, with more than 500,000 tags mounted directly on IT servers. There has never been a report of data loss or degradation in any storage or security device due to the presence and/or operation of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> tags and readers.
