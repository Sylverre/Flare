        <p>Asset attributes hold specific pieces of information about assets. Administrators may define as many asset attributes as needed to properly represent the various assets to be managed. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> supports a variety of different types of attributes.&#160; </p>
        <p>There are three main categories of Attributes: Asset Attributes, Status Attributes, and Calculated Asset Attributes. Asset Attributes are pre-defined and cannot be changed. (A Name is an Asset Attribute.) Status Attributes describe the condition of an asset. (Online Status is a Status Attribute.) Calculated Asset Attributes are created and defined with formulas, and are used for dynamic reporting and alerts of Summary Assets. </p>
