        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541417"></a>Reports and Graphs Overview</h1>
        <p>The Reports and Graphs task is available in both the Admin Console and the User Console. From the User Console, reports and graphs relevant to managed assets and environmental monitoring can be created or managed. System reports and graphs are created and managed in the Admin Console.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Reports/Graphs task includes six sub-tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Manage Reports</span>: Create report criteria and then run reports either by manual selection or schedule. Once a report is created and executed, the result of the report is available in Reports. </li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Reports</span>: View the progress of reports that are running and access the data of reports that are complete.&#160;  Completed reports can be viewed immediately or exported in XML, CSV, PDF, or SQLite formats.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Manage Graphs</span>: Create graph criteria and run graphs by manual selection or schedule. Once a graph is created and run, the result is available in Graphs. </li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Graphs</span>: View the progress of graphs that are running and access the data of graphs that are complete.&#160; Completed graphs can be viewed immediately or exported in PNG format.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Actions</span>: Deliver a report or graph to one or more recipients when the report or graph is run either on a schedule or interactively from the user interface. You can select from three protocols when creating Actions: Email, HTTP Post, and FTP.&#160; Once an action is defined, it can be assigned to a report or graph.&#160; Any number of actions can be assigned to an individual report or graph and any number of reports or graphs can share the same Actions.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">BIRT Templates</span>: Upload and configure BIRT&#160;templates. Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT™) is an open-source report generation tool developed by the Eclipse™ Foundation. You can create reports in the BIRT Designer and then add them to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> where the report will be executed. The BIRT module enables a rich variety of features, such as custom formatting, charts, data grouping and logos. You can even include data from multiple reports and external data sources to create reports tailored to your specific needs. </li>
        </ul>
