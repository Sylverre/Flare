        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541352"></a>Asset Templates</h1>
        <p>In the User Console, you can create templates to facilitate the addition of new assets.&#160;Asset templates are also well-suited to adding assets with use of a barcode scanner. The asset template can have one or more attributes already filled in with default data to avoid reentering repetitive data for multiple assets that are being added to the system. Views are used in the Dashboard and Assets Task to define which attributes are included in the view when displaying the asset list. The views will also determine column ordering of the attributes being displayed.</p>
