        <p>Alerts are similar to Events, but have to be configured separately with Thresholds instead of with Triggers. For Alerts there is an Alert Viewer as well. Alerts can be configured by and for both Administrators and Users. The first three sub-tasks are available in both the Admin Console and the User Console, but in the Admin Console, there is also a Global Alert Policy sub-task.</p>
        <p>Alerts have Actions much like Events do.&#160; The information available in Alert Actions is much the same as that available in Event Actions.&#160; Configuring Alert Alerts is also essentially the same as configuring Event Actions, although Alerts have Thresholds (while Events have Triggers).</p>
