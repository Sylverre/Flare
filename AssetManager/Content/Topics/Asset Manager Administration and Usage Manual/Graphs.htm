        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541425"></a>Graphs</h1>
        <p>Graphs and Reports are very similar. As with Reports, Graphs are first defined and then run, either manually from the Graphs task area or programmatically through scheduling and other functions.</p>
        <p>The major difference between Reports and Graphs is that Graphs allow you to create visual representations of the same information that you can create with Reports, although there is a balance between how much information you include in your Graphs and how useful or discernible the information is to you, that is, if you include too many parameters, your Graph will at best not be visually appealing and at worst not informative or useful at all.&#160; </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> provides a number of Graph Templates with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> that you can use to create Graphs about the data being collected by your readers and Zone Manager(s). These Graph Templates can be customized in order to suit your needs to view specific information. There is also a Custom Graph Template for readers and Zone Managers that allow for complete customization of the contents of the Graph within the bounds of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> graphing capabilities.</p>
