        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support Knowledge Base (<a href="http://support.rfcode.com/">support.rfcode.com</a>) is the best resource to use when you encounter an error.&#160; Some errors are presented if you are trying to perform an action in the system that is not allowed.&#160; Generally, you will find Notes about performing various tasks to help you avoid this type of error, but the Knowledge Base contains further explanation about the causes of these errors and what actions to take to configure and/or use the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> system properly. Two examples of this kind of error message and the knowledge base articles related to them are the following:</p>
        <p><a href="http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/760436">Delete Failed. The item could not be deleted.</a>
            <br /><a href="http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/748632"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> Cannot Connect to the local Microsoft SQL Express Database</a>
        </p>
        <p>The other major category of error messages appear more like programming or code-based error messages.&#160; Some of these are known issues with various versions of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> and therefore the best solution is to upgrade <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> to the latest version.&#160; However, no code is completely without error, so please bring these to the attention of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support.&#160; </p>
        <p>An example of this kind of error is the following:</p>
        <p><a href="http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/899826">java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 415 for URL</a>
        </p>
