        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541451"></a>Asset Links</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Asset Links are filtered Views added to the Assets menu to simplify and streamline navigation. Created by the system administrator, Asset Links can be made available to all users, and can be used to restrict the data visible to specified user groups. Locking an Asset Link prevents users other than those with system administrator access from making changes to the link, though not to any assets reached by using that link. Asset Link View allow for specific custom views to be applied/restricted/allowed for the Asset Link. An Asset Link must be created before an Asset Link View can be customized.</p>
        <p>
            By default there are three Asset Links which in previous versions of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> were not able to be modified or deleted.&#160; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> also includes several <a href="#Enable">Standard Asset Link Views</a> that can be selected by a Systems Administrator and are then available to users with the appropriate permissions.</p>
