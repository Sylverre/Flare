        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> &#160; In order to view a description of and a detailed list of the specific asset types, attributes, etc. contained within either schema, click to highlight the schema and then click the <span class="Strong">Schema Description</span> button.&#160; The same information from each description is presented below, but it can be accessed from within the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> web interface at any time as well.</p>
        <p>While one schema is more extensive than the other, both are extremely comprehensive.&#160; As such, you will probably not need all of the Asset Types and Asset Attributes that become available to you after you import one or the other schema.&#160; If you want to delete those types and attributes that you do not need or will not need in the near future, there is no harm in doing so.&#160; You can always add them back later.&#160; In addition, if there are any types or attributes that you will need and which are not included in either schema, please contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support for assistance.&#160; It’s not prohibitively difficult to create them on your own and the system easily allows this, but if you are new to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, then you might create more than you need or create them in a way that is not optimal or effective for your specific needs.&#160; <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Professional Services are resources available; our team is always ready to assist you in the management of your assets and the monitoring of your environment.</p>
        <p>The two default schemas are described in detail below.</p>
