        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541356"></a>Expected Location</h1>
        <p>When you populate the system with your assets, you have the option to define an expected location.&#160; Expected Locations are just that: where an asset is expected to be.&#160; <br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/03000038.png" style="height: 394px;width: 657px;" class="img_2" /></p>
        <p>If a tag reports that it (and the Asset associated with it) are not at the Expected Location, then you can be alerted or determine the next course of action to take for managing your asset. If <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> cannot determine the current Location of an Asset, the Location field will display “Unknown,” or it will display the last known Location, depending on how <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> has been configured.&#160; </p>
        <p>Determining where an asset actually is located is a function of server configuration, readers, tags, locators, and/or rules. Server configuration for Locations is covered in the <a href="Configuration for Unknown.htm#_Configuration_for_Unknown">Configuration for Unknown Locations</a>. Configuration for readers, tags, locators, and/or rules is covered in those respective sections.</p>
