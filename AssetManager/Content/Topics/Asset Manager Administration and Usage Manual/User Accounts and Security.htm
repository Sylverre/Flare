        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">A unique User ID must be created for each person using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. A Systems Administrator can set the level of access each user has to information in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.  Security configurations can be made at the user, group, or asset level.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">User Roles define the overall level of access a user has to the system: view, create, edit, or manage.  Groups can be used to set the locations or asset attributes multiple users will be able to view, or the access levels they have with regard to certain locations or asset attributes.  Asset Links allow system administrators to control the items available to users in the Assets task.</p>
        <p>Security in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> is achieved through the addition and configuration of Roles, Groups, Permissions, and some Advanced Asset Security options for User accounts.</p>
