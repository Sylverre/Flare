        <p>Assets are the physical objects that are managed and/or monitored with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, from inventory items such as blade servers and laptops to employees and visitors to environmental sensors.  Assets are classified in Types and have Attributes.  Assets are assigned to Locations and Expected Locations, and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can alert you whenever they are not in those assigned locations. There is also a special class of Assets called Summary Assets that are explained in the <a href="Summary Assets.htm#_Summary_Assets">Summary Assets</a> section.&#160;</p>
