        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541426"></a>Manage Graphs</h1>
        <p>The Manage Graphs task lets you&#160; specify what will be graphed and how. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> provides some standard graph templates to help you create graphs, but you can also create completely customized Graphs.</p>
        <p>Graphs can be created on both the Admin Console and the User Console. Configuration fields differ depending upon the type of Graph. Graphs are produced in a linear style with the axis determined by the criteria you specify.</p>
        <h2>To Create a New Graph</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <span class="strong">Reports/Graphs &gt;&#160;Manage Graphs</span> and click <span class="strong">New</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the Graph Template from the drop-down.</li>
            <li>Complete all required and any desired additional fields.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Name:</span> Assign a name to the Graph.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Create output only if data exists:</span> check this box to prevent the creation of empty reports. If unchecked, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will create a report if a report is scheduled to be created, even if the report contains no data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Execution User Account:</span> On the User Console, this drop-down menu provides a list of <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-17T17:32:00.3012877-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="No idea what that means!  Do group names appear here, as well as individual user IDs?  Looks like only a single selection is possible. " MadCap:editor="Pappillon" MadCap:editDate="2015-06-26T10:08:23.8211785-05:00">users. The Execution User Account, when used in conjunction with Admin Security, can limit report execution to authorized users. The default value of Admin is appropriate for most situations.</MadCap:annotation></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Lead In Timestamps:</span> Include attribute state changes if they occurred before the specified report time. For example, if you are generating a report to show offline assets during a specific week, and some of the assets went from online to offline before the report start time, then that information will be included in the report. If you leave this box unchecked, the report will only show the state of the attribute at the specified start time.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Time Type:</span>Select from Relative, Specific, Calendar, or Consolidated Time Range. </li>
            <li><span class="strong">Consolidated Report Time:</span> If Consolidated Time Range is chosen, select from Beginning of consolidated report, End of consolidated report, or Same time range as consolidated <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-26T10:11:06.6234903-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="An explanation wouldn't go amiss!"
