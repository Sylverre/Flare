        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /><sup>TM</sup> is an enterprise-class software application. It is a highly scalable asset tracking and asset management software solution that is tightly integrated with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />’s Real-Time Locating System (RTLS) readers and asset tags.&#160;It is also an advanced environmental monitoring software solution that is tightly integrated with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />’s line of wire-free environmental sensors.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> combines powerful, yet easy-to-use tools for configuring locations and asset hierarchies, creating comprehensive views of how critical assets are deployed across departments, buildings, or entire organizations. All current and historical Asset Attributes, such as financial information, physical location, and contractual information can be maintained in a database, enabling complete asset life cycle management. Inventory reports are available at the touch of a button so users can proactively respond to audits and automate their regulatory compliance efforts.</p>
        <p>When deployed with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />’s active RFID tags and readers, physical asset location is tracked in real-time to quickly locate and identify equipment for maintenance and service, avoiding costly downtime. Automated alerts and reports can be configured for immediate notification of asset location or condition changes, delivering savings in both cost and time.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />’s secure browser-based web interface requires no software to be installed or maintained on user systems, and role-based user accounts make it easy for system administrators to control who can view and who can modify asset details and conditions within the deployment environment.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, combined with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />’s active RFID hardware, provides an end-to-end solution for real-time asset tracking and environmental monitoring. In addition, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> can greatly enhance existing DCIM systems.</p>
