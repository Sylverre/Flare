        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.SourceText">In the Admin Console, the Reports/Graphs task lets you produce tabular and summary Reports about Readers, Zone Managers and Users that are established and managed by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />. Tabular reports are simply reports in spreadsheet format with columns of attributes and rows of data, while summary reports are counts and simple aggregates of data, such as the number of server assets or the average daily temperature in a given location.&#160; In addition to reports, you can also create graphical representations (Graphs) of reader states, reader noise levels, Zone Managers states, asset conditions, and environmental conditions. In the User Console, assets being managed and monitored by the system can be graphed and reported on.&#160; </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Reports provide summary and tabular data about assets and attributes, system users, and the system itself. Tabular reports are reports in spreadsheet format with columns of attributes and rows of data, while summary reports are counts and simple aggregates of data, such as the number of server assets or the average daily temperature in a given location. Graphs display information about reader states, reader noise levels, Zone Manager states, asset conditions, or environmental conditions in a visual fashion. Reports and graphs can be scheduled to run automatically, and be configured for automatic delivery by email, FTP, or HTTP post.</p>
