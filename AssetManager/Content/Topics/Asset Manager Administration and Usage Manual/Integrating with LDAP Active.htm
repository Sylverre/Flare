        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541453"></a>Integrating with LDAP / Active Directory</h1>
        <p>The following instructions will help you to configure <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> to connect to an Active Directory or other LDAP server running on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">As of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> v2.8, access to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> can now be granted based on LDAP Group membership.&#160;This means that users that have never logged into <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> can do so without an Admin explicitly creating a User account.&#160; Instead, an Administrator can grant access to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> to an entire LDAP User Group, for example <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />s.&#160; Thus a new employee to the company can be granted membership to that User Group and therefore be granted login rights based solely on Group membership without any additional administration needed within <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />.&#160;&#160; This lightens the load for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> system Administrator, especially for installations with a very large User population.
