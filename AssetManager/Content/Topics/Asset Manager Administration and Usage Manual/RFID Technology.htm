        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541316"></a>RFID Technology</h1>
        <p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology uses radio waves to identify objects. A radio transmitter (called a tag) is attached to the object to be identified. A radio receiver (called a reader) decodes and reports the tag transmissions within its coverage zone. The reader forwards this information over wired or wireless networks.<br /><br />Each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> tag has its own on-board power supply, a CR2032 coin cell battery. Tags operate with a very low duty cycle; every 10 seconds, the tag wakes up and broadcasts a very short status message at 433 MHz before it sleeps again. The tags are one-way transmitters. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> readers are dual-channel receivers tuned to receive signals at 433 MHz. They do not use high-powered radio or magnetic fields to energize or trigger the tags in any way.<br /><br />Typical RFID applications include item tracking, inventory control, asset management and environmental monitoring. A specific example is the tracking of servers and network equipment in the data center. The impact of RFID on IT systems depends on three factors: the power of the transmission, the distance from the emission source, and the type of equipment in the path of the transmission. </p>
