        <p>In addition to viewing report results inside <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, report results can be exported to PDF, XML, CSV, BIRT CSV, or SQLite formats.</p>
        <p>There are two places from which you can export reports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Reports sub-task there is an Export button with a combo field to the right of it.&#160; Choose the format in the combo field and then click the Export button to export the report.</li>
            <li>When viewing the results of a report in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> the View Report window has three buttons corresponding to the three format types that are available for export.&#160; Simply click the button corresponding to your desired format and the report will be exported.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you choose to export a report, you will either be prompted to save the report or your browser will open it in a new window/tab, depending on how your browser is configured.</p>
