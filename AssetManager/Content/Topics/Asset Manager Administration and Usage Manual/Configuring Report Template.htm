        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541421"></a>Configuring Report Template Definitions </h1>
        <p>Configuring report definitions is essentially the same in both the Admin Console and in the User Console, with the exception that the User Console offers an additional Security configuration option that lets the Report creator define an Execution User Account.&#160; Otherwise, the configuration fields are the same for both, although the Attribute options for Filters, Conditions, and Columns differ depending upon what type of report is chosen, that is, you can display Temperature in a Temperature Report defined in the User Console but not in a Reader Noise Report defined in the Admin Console, for obvious reasons.</p>
        <p>The report editor is divided into the following sections: Basic Information, Security, Time, Schedule, Actions, Filter, Post-Condition, Exception Condition, Columns</p>
        <p>The first five&#160; sections available when configuring Report Definitions are shown:</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Basic Information</h2>
        <p>The Basic Information section lets you name the report. Each report must have a unique name. The name can be long and have spaces. Long names are fine, especially since each Report name should give enough information to let you and others know exactly what kind of report it is. </p>
        <p class="note">For more information about Advanced Reporting with BIRT, refer to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> website: <a href="http://www.rfcode.com/Software/advanced-reporting-module.html">http://www.rfcode.com/Software/advanced-reporting-module.html</a> The Basic Information section also has a checkbox "Create output only if data exists". When this is checked the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> system will only create report output if there is representative data in the database for the conditions that you have specified. This prevents the system from generating reports that have no data rows.</p>
        <p>If the box is checked and you do try to run a report without data, an Undefined Output message appears:<br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/0300009F.png" style="height: 159px;width: 503px;" class="img_2" /></p>
