        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541429"></a>Running Graphs</h1>
        <p>Graphs are shown in a table of available graph outputs.&#160; Graphs are categorized in the graph table by <span class="Strong">Name</span>, <span class="Strong">Job Start Time</span>,<span class="Strong"> Job Stop Time</span>, and<span class="Strong"> Graph Status</span>. </p>
        <p>The Name column is self-explanatory. The Start Time and Stop Time values for a Graph define the temporal boundaries for the data displayed in the Graph, for example, reader noise readings for a time range of a week starting at midnight (12:00 AM) on a Monday morning and ending at 11:59PM on the following Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Graph Status column lets you know if the Graph job has finished and if not, why not.&#160; Graph Status values are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Complete</span>: This indicates that the Graph job is complete and ready to be viewed or exported.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Queued</span>: This indicates that the Graph job is in the queue waiting to be run.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Running</span>: This indicates that the Graph job is currently running.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Failure</span>: This indicates that the Graph job failed due to an internal error.<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To view a graph, select the appropriate graph from the list and then click the <span class="Strong">View </span>button.<br /><br />A window will appear displaying the graph in PNG format, such as the one below.<br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/030000B5.png" style="height: 163px;width: 623px;" class="img_2" /></p>
