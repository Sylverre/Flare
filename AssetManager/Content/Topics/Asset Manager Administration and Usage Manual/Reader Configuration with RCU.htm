        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">&#160; For complete instructions, refer to the Reader Configuration Utility (RCU) User Guide, which ships with your reader and which is also available from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support Document Repository:&#160; <a href="http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/722910">http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/722910</a><![CDATA[  ]]></p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The <span class="span_13">Network</span> setup option is used to configure a reader that is connected to a network by means of an Ethernet connection; this setup option is generally used for production environments, particularly in data centers where one or more readers will be mounted above server rows. The <span class="span_13"><MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-04-29T10:34:13.0244858-05:00" MadCap:creator="DSFoxx" MadCap:initials="DSF" MadCap:comment="format? " MadCap:editor="DSFoxx" MadCap:editDate="2015-04-29T10:34:15.1896097-05:00">Local</MadCap:annotation></span> setup option is used to configure a reader that is connected to your PC by an RS-232 serial cable or a USB cable; this setup option is generally used only for smaller deployments and/or the initial configuration of the reader and is described in the Reader Configuration Utility User Guide.&#160; This manual only contains basic configuration instructions using the <span class="span_13">Network</span> option.</p>
