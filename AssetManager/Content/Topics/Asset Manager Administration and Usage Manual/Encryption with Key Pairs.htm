        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> readers support SSL based on x.509 certificates. These can be generated using key pairs in a wide variety of formats. Some of the encryption keys generated in the process of building these certificates can be generated using passcodes (passkeys). However, this portion of the key-generation process is irrelevant to the process of verifying the validity of the key pairs during SSL processing.</p>
