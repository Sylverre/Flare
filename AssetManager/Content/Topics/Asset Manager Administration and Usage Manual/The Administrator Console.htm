        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541332"></a>The Administrator Console</h1>
        <p>The Administrator Console is used to manage the system infrastructure. It is used by an administrator to set up a system structure for the purpose of discovering, monitoring, and managing assets that have been tagged with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Active RFID tags. The Administrator Console provides (or enables) the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Dashboard</span>: to configure the primary views for end-users of the system</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Configuration</span>: to configure the parts of the system necessary for viewing and storing tag data</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Customization</span>: to create asset templates, views, skins and links for users </li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Integration</span>: to configure optional modules that integrate with third-party hardware and software</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Location/Rules/Maps</span>: to configure the logical structure that represents your physical deployment of tags, readers, and IR locators</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Data Schema</span>: to configure the types, assets, and sensors you will be using and the specific attributes of them that are important to you; however, for most deployments, this should not need to be modified.&#160; Consult with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support if you think you need to modify the default schema</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Security</span>: to configure user accounts and access levels in the system</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Reports/Graphs</span>: to configure the presentation of data that is reported from the system</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Events</span>: to configure the types, parameters, and triggers of system-generated notifications when certain conditions occur so that administrators can manage the hardware and the software of the system</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Alert Management</span>: much like Event configuration, Alert Management is used to configure the types and parameters of system-generated notifications when certain conditions occur so that end users can manage the state and status of assets and the environment that is being monitored</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Administrator Console is divided into two main regions, or panes. The left side is the navigation pane where the tasks and sub-tasks are located. </p>
        <p>To the right of this is the task pane which contains several varying task panes depending on the main and sub-task selected. The administrator console also contains an information bar on the bottom of the screen, which contains two main features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">User Indicator</span>: shows the username (or admin) who is currently logged on and using the web interface session.</li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Bottom Navigation Links</span>: Logout, Link, About, User Console<br /><br /><ul><li><span class="underscore">Logout</span>: Click Logout to end the current web interface session.</li><li><span class="underscore">Link</span>: Click Link to create a URL string that can be copied and pasted into an email or browser tab.&#160; Two Link options are provided, one that opens to the view in use, or a Single Page option that opens only the active pane and does not include the Task Pane.</li><li><span class="underscore">About</span>: Click About to show the version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li><li><span class="underscore">User Console</span>: Click User Console to switch to the User Console from the Admin Console. In the same place in the web interface, the link will read Admin Console if the user is logged into the User Console.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
