        <p>Calculated Asset Attributes are attributes that are derived from computations requiring data from other attributes. The default schemas provided with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> include a number of Calculated Asset Attributes to enable real-time monitoring and management. These preset calculated asset attributes cannot be <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-30T13:55:47.1600963-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="correct for AM?"

        <p>Three common uses of Calculated Asset Attributes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To calculate a new Attribute for an Asset from an existing Attribute on the same Asset; for example, a warranty expiration date calculated as a difference from asset purchase date<br /></li>
            <li>To calculate one Attribute for an Asset from an Attribute that already exists on a different Asset; for example, the average temperature of a group of assets that involves aggregating the total temperature reported by a group of sensor tags <br /></li>
            <li>To calculate an attribute for an asset from a number of attributes from various assets in a specific location; for example, computing the maximum or average temperature for all sensor tags in a location</li>
        </ul>
