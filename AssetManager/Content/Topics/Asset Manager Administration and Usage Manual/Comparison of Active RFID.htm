MadCap:editor="DSFoxx" MadCap:editDate="2015-04-29T14:36:38.5784439-05:00">“</MadCap:annotation>Some cellular telephones typically operate in the same frequency range for UHF RFID and with an emission power of about 200-600 milliwatts and more… Cell phones are commonly used near, beside, or even within (3G/GPRS cards) IT equipment… Thus far, no harmful RF interference from these uses has been reported.”</p>
        <p>The maximum radiated emission from an RF tag operating at 433 MHz is less than 0.0028 milliwatts.</p>
        <p>To put <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> tag power emissions in perspective, consider that cellular telephones operate with emission power levels that are 70,000 to 210,000 times greater than those emitted by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> active RFID tags.&#160; {200 mW ÷ 0.0028 mW = 71,429}</p>
