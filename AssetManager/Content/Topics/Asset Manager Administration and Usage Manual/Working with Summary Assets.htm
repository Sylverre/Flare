        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541361"></a>Working with Summary Assets </h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">A Summary Asset can be used just like a standard Asset. It can be defined with any number of attributes just like standard Assets, and will appear in the Table View. The default schema has three types of assets already defined in the system in a hierarchy which represents “best practice” for defining and structuring Summary Assets within <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />.&#160; This best practice is based on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> expertise and extensive deployment experience. At the top level of the hierarchy is the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Inventory: </span>Inventory Assets represent assets that are being tracked and managed.
            </li>
            <li><span class="strong">Sensor: </span>Sensor Assets represent sensors that are being managed.
            </li>
            <li><span class="strong">Summary</span> <span class="strong">– Location: </span>Summary – Location assets represent the Summary Assets that are being managed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/AM Asset Type - summary location hierarchy.bmp" style="width: 1283px;height: 652px;" class="imgfullwidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Within the hierarchy under all the main Asset types are subtypes. These can also be altered or changed in the Schema Editor if necessary.</p>
        <p>By grouping each of these types of Assets as peers, you can easily configure Table View filters and Reports to use specific categories of Assets. For example, if you want to view all of your Sensors, all it takes is a single click. The same is true for all Summary Assets .</p>
        <p>Out of the box, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> contains only a single Summary Asset (Summary – Location).&#160; However, both of the default asset schemas available for immediate import offer the following hierarchy of summary assets from which you can build your own structures.</p>
        <p>When you create a Summary Asset and associate it to a Location, be sure to select the appropriate level or point in the hierarchy in order to properly classify the Summary Asset. </p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions=""><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541362"></a>Summary Assets and Locations</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">A Location can represent a campus, a building, a floor, a room, a sub-room, as well as rows of a data center and even individual racks in a data <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-30T13:18:55.9436220-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="non-CS examples?" MadCap:editor="Pappillon" MadCap:editDate="2015-06-30T13:19:00.3248726-05:00">center.</MadCap:annotation> In the Administrator Console, Locations are modeled as a location hierarchy or location tree. <br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/0300003D.png" style="height: 256px;width: 228px;" class="img_2" /><br /><br />Above is an example of Locations defined in the location tree that represent a data center with six rows (A-F) and 10 racks in each row. Notice that the Locations get more specific deeper into the location tree (for example, Austin Data Center &gt; Row A &gt; Rack 1).</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">A Summary Asset – an Asset that represents a Location – is a unique object that must be explicitly created by the system Administrator. Not all Locations need to be represented by a Summary Asset. It depends upon the Location and the needs of the end users, which is why it is left up to the Administrator to decide and create. When you create a Summary Asset, you are associating (tying) it to a specific Location. Any location can have a corresponding Summary Asset associated to it.<br />Some locations have an obvious need to be treated as both an Asset and a Location. A good example of this duality is a Location that represents an IT Rack in a data center. Each rack is clearly a Location that holds other Assets (for example, servers, appliances, storage systems). However, each IT Rack is also an Asset unto itself that needs to be tracked and managed. Another example is a mobile location, such as a truck or a ship, both of which are themselves assets, but both can also contain other assets.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions=""><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541363"></a>Summary Assets and Assets</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">On the User Console, Asset objects (Assets) are created to represent the assets that are being managed and tracked. Assets can be inventory items such as computers, monitors, etc. or they can be sensors such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, etc. Assets can have a variety of attributes associated with them such as name, serial number, asset tag ID, location, date of installation/deployment, color, weight, size, cost, warranty status, sensor values, etc. Assets can be placed (automatically or manually) into locations represented by the location tree.<br /><br />It is important to understand that Locations and Assets are separate structures that behave differently and which are created in different parts of the system. Locations are not Assets and Assets are not Locations. Locations represent places and can only be created on the Administrator Console. Assets represent things and are created on the User Console. Summary Assets tie the two together.</p>

        <p>Each type of Summary Asset can have a variety of additional attributes to make the definition of the Summary Asset  more useful. Depending on the type of Summary Asset, the attributes available for configuring it may change and present drop-down boxes that help to further define the Summary Asset. </p>

        <h2><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541365"></a>Using Calculated Attributes with Summary Assets </h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.SourceText">Another type of attribute that is available to Summary Assets is called the Calculated Attribute. A Calculated Attribute applies a formula that takes data from one or more attributes, performs some calculation or evaluation of the data, and then stores the result in the Calculated Attribute itself. This application of a formula is similar to how they work in a spreadsheet. Calculated Attributes are automatically updated (recalculated) when any dependency data changes. This is an extremely powerful feature that provides great flexibility in customization. <br /><br />A simple example of a Calculated Attribute on a Summary Asset  would be a simple count of the number of assets in the Summary Asset. Remember that the Summary Asset  represents a location as well. Calculated Attributes on a Summary Asset  have access to the data stored in the attributes of the Summary Asset  itself as well as access to the data of all of the assets in the Summary Asset  location. Calculated Attributes can easily produce summary information about the population of assets in the Summary Asset  Location. This summary information derived from the Calculated Attributes on Summary Asset  is ideal information for Dashboard Views and Map Views. In fact, Calculated Attributes are one of the main reasons for creating Asset . <br />The Rack Cooling Index (RCI) and the Return Temperature Index (RTI), valuable data center metrics, are both included in the default schema and available for use when you define Summary Asset. For example, if you take the three temperature values of temperature sensors placed at the top, middle, and bottom of a rack and you apply the RCI formula inherent in the RCI Calculated Attribute, you can calculate the RCI for the rack. By defining a Summary Asset at the row level, you can similarly calculate RCI for the row as well.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Calculated Attributes can be applied to Assets and Summary Assets, but not to Locations.  A Calculated Attribute applies a formula to data from one or more attributes and stores the result.  Whenever the source attribute data changes, the Calculated Attribute automatically recalculates.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Calculated Attributes applied to a Summary Asset have access to all the attribute data of the Summary Assets and all the assets assigned to that Summary Asset.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Calculated Attributes allow you to customize <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for your particular needs.  You can, for example, create or edit calculated attributes to produce real-time counts of assets in a summary asset (summary - location) to display on a dashboard or use with Conditional <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-03T10:40:10.3989295-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="hyperlink!" MadCap:editor="Pappillon" MadCap:editDate="2015-06-03T10:40:13.1180850-05:00">Formatting</MadCap:annotation> for a map showing environmental conditions.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Several Calculated Attributes are included in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, available once you define Summary Assets.  Among these are the Rack Cooling Index (RCI) and Return Temperature Index (RTI).    For example, if you take the three temperature values of temperature sensors placed at the top, middle, and bottom of a rack and you apply the RCI formula inherent in the RCI Calculated Attribute, you can calculate the RCI for the rack. By defining a Summary Asset  at the row level, you can similarly calculate RCI for the row as well.</p>
        <p>Calculated Attributes are defined and configured by the Administrator in the Schema Editor.&#160; For more information, refer to the <a href="Status Attributes.htm#_Calculated_Asset_Attributes">Calculated Asset Attributes</a> section in this document.</p>
        <h2>Review of Summary Assets</h2>
        <p>Summary Assets count as licensed assets.&#160; They do not necessarily need to be created for each and every Location defined in the system; it all depends upon your scenario and the level of summary information you wish to collect. For example, to use RCI and RTI metrics, you will need to use those Calculated Attributes associated with the proper Summary Assets. While Summary Assets themselves do not require greater computing resources, the Calculated Attributes associated to the Summary Assets do. The default schemas have Calculated Attributes associated with the Summary Assets; therefore, using a large number of Calculated Attributes can result in higher CPU utilization and database activity on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> server. When needed, you can always create new Summary Assets. Finally, as with any other Assets, you can use all of the following with Summary Assets: Table Views, Map Views, Dashboard Views, Alerts &amp; Thresholds, Reporting, and Graphing.
