        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Dashboards are customizable groupings of widgets, which let you monitor attributes visually.  One or more widgets can be configured in a dashboard that will then show the information you have selected in easy to understand bars, dials, grids, graphs, or lists. There is no limit to the number of dashboards that can be <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-10T12:34:49.6767078-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="verify?"

        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.SourceText">Multiple dashboards can be configured using graphical widgets to represent attribute values that can be monitored with the dashboard function. Several versions of dashboards can be created, saved, copied and deleted to utilize any of a number of widget selections.
