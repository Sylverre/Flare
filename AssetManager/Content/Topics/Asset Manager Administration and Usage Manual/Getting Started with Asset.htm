        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> is a robust enterprise application that is easy to install and use almost immediately, but it has incredible flexibility to accommodate complex environments and enormous deployments of millions of tags and assets. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-04-27T12:15:05.1872863-05:00" MadCap:creator="DSFoxx" MadCap:initials="DS" MadCap:comment="Pitch?!  &quot;Easy to install and use...but has incredible flexibility...however...&quot;  I'm okay with those first two, more or less; the third, however...  Let's just say it isn't helpful and move on.  No need to compare it to anything else, and the &quot;requirement&quot; is quelling to say nothing worse.  Delete the sentence and tweak what remains?\r\n\r\n  " MadCap:editor="DSFoxx" MadCap:editDate="2015-04-27T12:20:04.5544091-05:00">However</MadCap:annotation>, as with any system that can be both simple and complicated to manage, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> requires a fundamental understanding of its structure and the possibilities therein, as well as knowledge of the quickest paths to determine what direction is right for your particular needs.</p>
        <p>With any asset management system, the fundamental structure involves assets (objects or conditions of interest), the location of those assets, and the state of those assets.&#160; This summary encompasses the need to keep data center computing equipment functioning optimally, expensive hospital equipment tracked and available for easiest use.</p>
        <p>Typically, a system administrator installs and configures the application and database for a population of end users.&#160; <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> is no different.&#160; This guide is written for an audience of administrators, as they need to know everything, and then some, about the application they are deploying and/or supporting.&#160; Within this guide are also the means by which end-users can access the information they need to ensure that their assets are functioning and functioning optimally.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that there are assets in the system and that these assets have attributes (characteristics with values). This distillation of objects and relationships accounts for physical objects that are managed through physical structures as well as the physical conditions of the environments in which the physical objects exist.&#160; <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> provides a dynamic map of the territory for which you are responsible.&#160; This map will tell you where your assets are, how they are doing, and if they move, then you’ll know that they did and you’ll know where they went if they are still in your territory.&#160; If an asset does leave your territory, then you’ll know where it was prior to departure. </p>
