        <p>To delete an Asset Type, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate in the <span class="strong">Admin Console </span>to <span class="strong">Data Schema &gt; Asset Type</span>. <br />The Asset Type task pane appears on the right.<br /></li>
            <li>Select the Asset Type you wish to delete from the Asset Type hierarchy tree and then click the <span class="strong">Delete</span> button.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> You can only delete an Asset Type if it is not in use. If any assets of the selected type have been added to the system you will receive a notification that the Asset Type cannot be deleted, such as the error message below.<br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/0300002D.png" style="height: 90px;width: 502px;" class="img_2" /><br /></p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> If you receive the notification that an Asset Type is in use, you must first delete all of the assets of the specified type (via the <span class="span_3">User Console</span>) before the Asset Type can be deleted.<br />After you delete an Asset Type, it will be removed from the Asset Type hierarchy tree.
