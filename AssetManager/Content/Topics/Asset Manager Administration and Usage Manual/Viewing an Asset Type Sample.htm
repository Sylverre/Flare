        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541350"></a>Viewing an Asset Type Sample Input Form  </h1>
        <p>The purpose of the Sample Input Form is to display the entry form that users will see when they go to add an asset to the system within the User Console. </p>
        <p>The following steps will guide you through viewing an Asset Type Sample Input Form:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate in the <span class="strong">Admin Console to Data Schema &gt; Asset Type</span>.</li>
            <li>Click the button <span class="strong">View Sample Input Form</span>.<br />The Sample Input Form appears.<br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/0300002C.png" style="height: 495px;width: 497px;" class="img_2" /><br /><br />The Sample Input Form above shows an example of the Asset Type entry window for the selected Asset Type. The numbers surrounded by parenthesis to the left of each field name is the Field Order assigned when each field was added to its respective asset type and is displayed here to help with managing the form layout. These numbers will not be displayed in the User Console when the input form is presented. You have full control over the organization of the fields on the form, which will be covered later in this document.<br /></li>
            <li>Click the <span class="strong">Close</span> button to close the Sample Input Form window.
            </li>
