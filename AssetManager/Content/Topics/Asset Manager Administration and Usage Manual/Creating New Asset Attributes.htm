        <h1>Asset Attributes</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Asset Attributes define properties or characteristics of Assets. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />᾽s data schema defines Asset Attributes useful in a data center. System Administrators can define as many additional attributes as needed to hold specific pieces of information about assets to be managed or monitored.</p>
        <p>Attributes can be added to Asset Types and will then appear in the Create: <span class="ital">Asset</span> dialog box when users create new Assets.</p>
        <h2><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541370"></a>  Create an Asset Attribute</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <span class="strong">Admin Console &gt; Data Schema &gt; Asset Attributes</span>.<br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/03000044.png" style="height: 265px;width: 384px;" class="img_2" /><br />The asset attributes task pane appears on the right. It is divided into two sections, which are the list of defined asset attributes on the left and the asset attribute editor on the right. At the top of the task pane are two buttons which are <span class="strong">New </span>and <span class="strong">Delete</span>.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>
                Click the <span class="strong">New </span>button at the top of the task pane.<br /><br /><img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/03000045.png" style="height: 112px;width: 443px;" class="img_2" /><br /><br />                The asset attribute editor section of the task pane opens a form with fields to configure the new Asset Attribute. <img src="../../Images/UserManual for reference/03000046.png" style="height: 220px;width: 525px;" class="img_2" /><br /><br />The asset attribute editor is grouped into two areas which are Name and Type and Asset Type(s) Using Attribute. The Name and Type area contains the basic definition of the new attribute. The Asset Type(s) Using Attribute will list all asset types currently using the asset attribute. This list will be empty until the asset attribute is added to an asset type.<br /></li>
            <li>Complete the required and any desired additional fields. <br /></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Name:</span> Assign a name to the asset attribute. The name is used on all forms to prompt for the asset attribute data, so it is advised to use a clear, concise and intuitive name for the new attribute.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Description:</span> If desired, input a detailed comment describing purpose or meaning of the asset attribute.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Record Value Changes:</span> Check this box if this attribute is required for historical reporting.  If unchecked, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> retains only the current value of the attribute; no previous information is available.  If checked, all value changes for this attribute for the life of the asset will be recorded for historical reporting and life cycle management.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Values Are Unique:</span> Check if this value must be unique for each asset.  A Serial Number attribute must be unique; a Model Number need not be. Selecting this option ensures that duplicate values are not entered.<br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Restrictable:</span> Check this box if you would like this attribute to be one that can be limited to certain Groups.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Group-based restriction is completed in User Access.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Hide on User Console:</span> Check this box if you would like this attribute to be hidden when viewing assets in the User Console.&#160; This provides a way to assign attributes and values to assets as an administrative <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-05T10:14:27.9177165-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="verify: Hide on User Console is yes/no on viewing but not asset creation?  Restrictable is an option for &quot;going to mess with total access permission but not from here?  " MadCap:editor="Pappillon" MadCap:editDate="2015-06-05T10:18:58.7522074-05:00">function.</MadCap:annotation><br /></li>
            <li><span class="Strong">ID:</span> IDs must be globally unique. The ID field is the identifier the system uses to store the asset attribute values. By default the ID is auto-generated by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />. However, you may choose to override the auto-generated ID field to simplify import and export purposes. In this case, the ID would equate to the database table column that holds the asset attribute data. </li>
            <li><span class="Strong">Type:</span> Choose a Type from the drop-down menu of the Asset Attribute Types.&#160; Choose the type that best represents the type of data that users will be entering for the new asset attribute type.&#160; For most data types, an additional area will appear for specifying optional value constraints, formatting features, etc.&#160; Refer to the <a href="Attribute Types and Descriptions.htm#_Attribute_Types_and">Attribute Types and Descriptions</a> section for more information.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Click the <span class="Strong">Save Changes </span>button to save the new Attribute. The new Attribute appears in the list to the left.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The final area in this pane, Asset Type(s)&#160;Using Attribute, is empty for a newly created Attribute. It will populate when this Attribute is assigned to Assets.</p>
