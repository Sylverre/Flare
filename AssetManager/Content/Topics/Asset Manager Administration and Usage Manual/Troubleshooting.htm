        <p>As with troubleshooting in general, and more specifically with computer issues, it is best to know exactly what actions were taken immediately prior to the error or issue starting.&#160; Before contacting <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support, document as many details of the issue as you can.</p>
        <p>Also, as when troubleshooting any software application issues, first attempt to isolate the issue to the specific application by eliminating other possible causes for the behavior you are seeing; this encompasses knowing the hardware capabilities and utilization of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> application server and database server as well as knowing the network bandwidth limits and use.&#160; Standard performance monitoring means are always a good place to start, especially if problems seem to be happening with multiple applications, databases, and/or database instances.</p>
