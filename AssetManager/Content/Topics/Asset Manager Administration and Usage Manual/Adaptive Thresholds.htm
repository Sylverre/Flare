            Adaptive Alert Thresholds are a powerful feature enabled by license key. Adaptive thresholds enable mathematical comparatives using values and variables as part of the evaluation logic for thresholds. Adaptive thresholds are user-configurable allowing simple and complex logic to be expressed. For example, Adaptive Thresholds can compare an attribute to another attribute or compare an attribute to a mathematical formula involving additional attributes (variable) and constants (values). &#160;Furthermore, Adaptive Thresholds can leverage any type of attribute in the system including calculated attributes and statistical attributes. Some examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An attribute compared to a constant, such as “Daily Average Temperature &gt; 80 degrees F.” This example threshold allows you to receive a warning of temperature trends before they become an issue.</li>
            <li>An attribute compared to the addition of another attribute and a constant such as “Temperature &gt; Monthly Average Temperature + 15 degrees F.”&#160; The monthly average temperature of a facility may change depending on seasonal factors and still be within acceptable operating limits. This threshold allows you to look for outliers of longer-term trends. </li>
            <li>An attribute compared to the addition of two other attributes such as “Temperature &gt; Weekly Average Temperature + Weekly Standard Deviation. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adaptive Thresholds are set in the <b>User Console &gt;Alerts &gt;</b>Thresholds task. As an example, we will set a threshold that monitors for temperatures that are outside of the weekly average temperature.&#160; </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the <b>New</b> button</li>
            <li>Select <b>Adaptive Alert Threshold</b></li>
            <li>Enter a Name. In this example, it will be called “Weekly Temp – outliers in Austin”</li>
            <li>Filter by Asset Type. In this example, we selected Temperature-Humidity</li>
            <li>Optionally, other attributes can be selected to filter the results. In this example, we chose to filter by location (Austin Data Center)</li>
            <li>In the Adaptive Attribute section, we choose Temperature for the Adaptive Attribute. </li>
            <li>For the operator, we choose “&gt;”</li>
            <li>For the Adaptive Attribute Expression, we choose “Weekly Temperature Average + 10 + Weekly Temperature Standard Deviation”</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save Changes</b></li>
        </ul>
