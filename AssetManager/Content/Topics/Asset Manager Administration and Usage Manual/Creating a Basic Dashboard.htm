            <li>Select a Layout. <br />Collapse the Widgets folder or scroll down to the bottom of the Widgets/Layout pane to reach the Layout folder. Drag the Blank or Table layout to the Dashboard Preview Pane. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="Strong">Blank: </span>Choosing this layout option and dragging it to the Dashboard Preview Pane will place a blank box as the layout for the dashboard. The borders of this box can be manipulated by dragging the edges along the width or the height. More than one blank box can be placed on the Dashboard. Multiple widgets can be placed in one blank layout box. Blank layout boxes can also be used to create borders or blank spaces in the dashboard as well. <br />A Blank layout box can be removed from the Dashboard Preview Pane by right-clicking and selecting <span class="Strong">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="Strong">Table: </span>Choosing this layout option and dragging it to the Dashboard Preview Pane will prompt a Grid Row/ Columns box where the number of rows and columns for the table will be selected. Once the number of row/ columns desired are entered, a blank table will appear in the Dashboard Preview Pane. The borders of this table can be manipulated by dragging the edges along the width or the height. More than one table can be placed in a Dashboard and tables can be placed within cells of another Table in the Dashboard. <br />A table can be removed from the Dashboard by right-clicking and selecting the <span class="Strong">Delete table </span>option.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">If no layout is selected, the dashboard uses a single blank box. Widgets will stack vertically in increasingly smaller sizes, the first widget taking up half the available space, the second half of what remains, and so on until the space is too small to support additional widget placement.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select one or more Widgets. <br />Select the widget(s) desired from the Widgets/Layouts tree and drag to the Dashboard Preview Pane. Add as many or as few of the widgets that you desire to create your customized Dashboard.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Dials and LEDs appear in the preview pane as Unassigned. Graphs and Bar Charts do not appear in the Preview Pane at all. To view these widgets, define their settings and click <span class="strong">View</span> to view the dashboard in a new browser tab. To determine whether or not a box in the dashboard preview pane contains a widget that is not visible, click that box. The Widget Settings box remains empty if no widget has been placed.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Define Widget Settings. The Widget Settings pane appears when you drag a widget to the Dashboard Preview Pane. Select the Asset and Attribute to display in your custom dashboard. Configure the visual display features such as color, borders, title, fonts, etc. When you have the widget settings configured, click the <span class="Strong">Save Changes </span>button to save the settings. <br /> </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The table views of the dashboard can be customized to display or not display specific columns in the table views either through configuring with the widget settings or through the process described in the following. To hide any of these columns, click on the right side of the column where a menu arrow will appear. Scroll down to the Columns item and uncheck any of the columns that you would like to hide. You can also sort these columns in ascending or descending order alphabetically. The preferences that you establish for the setup of your table views and dashboard configuration are automatically saved and will appear in the manner you have established each time you login.</p>
