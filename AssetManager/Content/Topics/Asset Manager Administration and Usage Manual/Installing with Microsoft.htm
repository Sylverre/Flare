Microsoft SQL Express 2008 is provided as a part of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> installation package and installation wizard; however, it is intended for use in labs and for limited pilots. The Express version of SQL server is limited to 10GB of database size, and does not have the capability of performing scheduled backups. Also a Microsoft Management Console is not installed as part of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> install.&#160; </p>
        <p>When deploying in a production environment, use Microsoft SQL Server Standard (not Express), PostgreSQL, or DB2 so that you can perform essential database maintenance functions, such as backing up, restoring, re-indexing, and administering the data generated by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>To <a href="Configuring a Production Database.htm" MadCap:conditions="Default.SysManual">configure either PostgreSQL or SQL Server for production use</a>  with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, a database must be created that is not populated with data and a user account must be created and given full access to the database. Do not use the “root” or “sa” accounts for security reasons. The database can be run on the same system that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> is installed on or it can be run on a remote machine and accessed by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />. </p>
        <p>While knowledge of SQL statements and database schema are not required to administer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" />, administrators must know how to create, secure, backup, restore and re-index the database software they choose to use.</p>
