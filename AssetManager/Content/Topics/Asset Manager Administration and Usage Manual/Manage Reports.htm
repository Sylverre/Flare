        <h1><a name="__RefHeading___Toc414541419"></a>Manage Reports</h1>
        <p>The Manage Reports task lets you create Reports based on specific criteria. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> provides several predefined reports you can use and customize.  In addition, you can create Consolidated Reports which let you run multiple reports simultaneously so that they can be viewed or exported as a group.</p>
        <p>Reports in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> are created in a tabular style that produces a table output of multiple rows and columns based on the report criteria specified.</p>
