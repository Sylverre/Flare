        <p class="p_22">Other settings that can be configured for each User account include:&#160; </p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_36">
                <span class="Strong">Password</span>: Use this for Users created and managed within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> that are not authenticated by LDAP.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_36">
                <span class="Strong">Email Address(es)</span>: Enter the User’s email address.</li>

                <span class="Strong">Browser/OS Locale</span>: The user’s settings will be inherited from their local web browser settings.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_22">
                <span class="Strong">English</span> – Asset and Sensor Attributes will appear as those of the imperial or English (USA) systems of measurement, i.e., ounces, feet, temperature expressed in Fahrenheit, etc.</li>

                <span class="Strong">Time Zone</span>: Use this to set the time zone for the User.&#160; By default, this is set to Browser/OS Locale, but you can manually change it to hard code the time zone by choosing a time zone from the drop-down menu.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11_1">
                <span class="Strong">User Groups</span>: After these have been created, you can assign one or more Groups to each User account in order to allow the User to inherit traits assigned to the Group(s).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_44">
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; A User can be assigned to a User Group even if Advanced Security is not enabled on the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server; however, the assignment of Users to Groups enables advanced functionality only if Advanced Security is enabled.&#160; To configure Advanced Security settings, go to: <span class="Strong">Configuration</span> &gt; <span class="Strong">Server</span> &gt; <span class="Strong">Asset Security</span>.&#160; For more information about Advanced Security, refer to the <a href="../../../RFC-AM Comprehensive/Content/Asset Manager Administration and Usage Manual/User Accounts and Security.htm#_Advanced_Security">Advanced Security</a> section.&#160; Do not change the Advanced Security settings without first consulting RF Code Support.</p>
