        <p>Maps are created and edited under <span class="Strong">Location/Rules/Maps</span> &gt; <span class="Strong">Map Configuration</span>.&#160; Here you can create a visual representation of part or all of the Location Hierarchy and you can provide a summary of information about assets that are assigned to specific locations in the tree. Each location can have one or more maps associated with it. You can also create various Map Families which are categorizations of maps. One example of a Map family is Geographical, which can contain geographical illustrations of specific locations in the tree. Other examples include satellite maps, blueprints, surveys, and CAD drawings. Maps images can be of any size or format, including BMP, PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, etc.</p>
        <p>Maps can have various Hot Spots configured to show upon them. Hot Spots are used to specify a location on the map and also to provide a summary of information regarding assets assigned to specific locations so you can provide a quick and easily comprehensible visual representation of your assets and environmental conditions. </p>
        <p>Two useful features of Hot Spots are Hover Attributes and Hot Spot Links, and one useful feature of Maps in general is the ability to use Map Attributes. Hover Attributes can be assigned to any Hot Spot and are easily configured to display in further detail any number and manner of attributes for any map. Hot Spot Links let you link maps together, link to and display an asset (such as a sensor tag) on a map, or link to an external URL. Map Attributes let you display additional information about the map or part of it; these are configured using the Map Attributes Box, which you can place anywhere on a map.</p>
