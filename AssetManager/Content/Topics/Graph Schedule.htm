        <h4 class="Heading4">Graph Schedule</h4>
        <p>The Graph Schedule section allows the graph to be configured to run on a scheduled basis. Scheduled graphs can be run on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. When the Schedule button is clicked, the scheduler window will appear allowing you to select the appropriate schedule for the graph.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; You can only run five (5) graph jobs simultaneously. If you choose more than five Graphs to run at once, the first five will be processed and any remaining graphs will be queued until one of the currently running graphs is complete; this prevents long running or complex graphs from consuming all available system and database resources.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; When the time zone is altered on the Asset Manager server, some system features may behave unexpectedly (scheduled reports, alerts, etc.). After changing the time zone, reboot Asset Manager to apply the new time zone.</p>

            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; If you want to "turn off" the scheduled Graph while preserving the schedule settings, the Enable Schedule checkbox must not be checked; however, this checkbox must be checked in order for the schedule to take effect.</p>
