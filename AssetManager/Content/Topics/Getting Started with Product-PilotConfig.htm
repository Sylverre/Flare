        <p>This guide provides an overview of the steps necessary to complete a single-site pilot deployment of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. A pilot deployment uses a local Zone Manager, which is installed with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />,  and the included version of the Microsoft SQL Server Express database.</p>
        <p>After a successful pilot, a full roll-out can be accomplished using the same basic procedures with a fully enabled database and additional Zone Managers as required. Information about roll-out requirements is included in the Roll-Out section of this guide and in the Systems Administrator manual available at <a href="http://support.rfcode.com/">support.rfcode.com</a></p>
        <p>The installation requirements for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> are the same whether deploying as a pilot or a full roll-out to a production environment.</p>
