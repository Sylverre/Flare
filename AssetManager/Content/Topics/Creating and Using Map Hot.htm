        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="strong">Hot Spot Target</span>: Choose the type of target for the hot spot drawn (Asset, Location, Text, or URL). The hot spot attributes that will display in the reference box will relate to the target that is chosen and will also link to that location, asset or URL when the hot spot region is clicked upon in the map in the User Console. This will not be the case for the text target type. The text target type cannot hold attributes or be a hot link.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Asset/Location/Text/URL</span>: This field varies depending on the type of hot spot target that is chosen. If a location target is chosen, this field will require you to select a location to scope to from within the tree and will optionally allow you to choose a different map family than the map family currently being viewed. If an asset target is chosen then this field will require you to select an asset from your assets list. If text is chosen, this field allows you to add any text to the map, but will not hold any attributes or be a hot spot. If a URL target is chosen then this field will require you to input a URL to connect to and optionally will allow you to apply a label to this URL.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Data Box</span>: Choose between <span class="ital">None</span>, <span class="ital">Visible</span>, or <span class="ital">Include Hover</span>. If Include Hover is chosen, the text that would normally display only when the user hovers the mouse over the hot spot will instead display on the map. (Not available for Text or URL.)</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Fill Color</span>: Choose a fill color for the hot spot shape that has been drawn. If you do not specify a fill color, this setting will default to the Fill Color setting specified in your map᾽s settings. If your map᾽s settings do not have a fill color specified then the fill color will default to the Fill Color setting found in Global Settings.</li>
            <li><span class="strong">Fill Opacity</span>: Specify an opacity percentage that you would like for the fill area. The lower the percentage the more transparent the fill area will appear. For example a specification of 100% for this field will make the fill area completely opaque. If you choose not to specify a percentage for this field, this setting will default to the Fill Opacity setting specified in your map᾽s settings. If your map᾽s settings do not have a fill opacity specified then this setting will default to the Fill Opacity setting found in Global Settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The width of the hot spot data box will change relative to the scale and/or contents when viewing the map. The size of the data box shown when editing is the “Max width” when viewing the map image at 100%, meaning that depending on what text is being displayed, the data box may appear smaller than the width specified, but it will not grow wider than the width specified.</p>

        <p>Maps are generally separated by function; that is, one map may be made for displaying sensor readings, and a second map made for clicking through from larger to smaller geographical areas.  Depending on the amount of information to be displayed, these functions might be bundled into a single map.&#160; </p>
        <p>In the screenshot below, a building floor plan is used to provide users a visual means of selecting a desired location. Four Hot Spots have been created, each linking to another map. The Hot Spot Settings pane displays information for the selected Hot Spot, Data Hall 1200.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When accessed from the User Console, Hot Spot Settings are displayed. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Clicking on the hot spot brings up the nested map. This map displays all racks in Data Center 1200. When viewed from the User Console, the map includes real-time displays of Alerts, and each rack’s Asset Attributes display on hover.</p>
