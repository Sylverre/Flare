        <p>When placing sensor tags, follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attach your tags to the outside of rack doors using either the attached adhesive or optionally the lanyard bezel and a zip tie that is included with the tags. The former method (using adhesive) allows easier replacement of the sensor battery when necessary and requires a smaller footprint. The latter method (using the lanyard bezel) is often just a personal preference of data center managers. With both methods, attaching the sensor tags to the outside of the rack doors provides the best read range.<ul><li>To mount a tag on the door of the rack, clean the area of the door where you will be placing the sensor and then remove the release liner of the adhesive backing on the sensor tag and press the tag firmly into place centered on the outside of the rack door.</li></ul></li>
            <li>To achieve RCI, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />’s minimum recommendation is that you place at least three temperature tags on the front (top, middle, and bottom) of every third rack door. However, for the most accurate and granular data, you should place three temperature tags on the front (top, middle, and bottom) of each and every rack. If the racks have no doors, attach the sensors to the front of the side panel of the <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-19T12:22:39.8743388-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="Frank says check with Gregg for a better graphic" MadCap:editor="Pappillon" MadCap:editDate="2015-06-19T12:22:49.6247569-05:00">rack.</MadCap:annotation></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>An <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> best practice is to place temperature sensors at the top and bottom and a temperature-humidity sensor in the middle of the rack door. While not specifically necessary for RCI metrics, using temperature-humidity tags gains you visibility to moisture levels as well as heat in the server racks and rows, which further enhances your ability to monitor and manage your data center environment.</li>
            <li>Do not mount tags on hot surfaces, such as directly on a reader or on a server chassis; doing so can cause them to report inaccurate data.</li>
        </ul>
