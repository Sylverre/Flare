        <p class="p_10">The Administrator Console is used to manage the system infrastructure. It is used by an administrator to set up a system structure for the purpose of discovering, monitoring, and tracking assets that have been tagged with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> or third-party Active RFID tags. The Administrator Console provides (or enables) the following tasks:</p>

I really want a verdict on what these are called.  Also, this presentation is...not terribly engaging.
