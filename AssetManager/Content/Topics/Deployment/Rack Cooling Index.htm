        <p MadCap:conditions="General.New text,Default.NewText">The Rack Cooling Index (RCI) is a best-practice performance metric for quantifying the conformance with thermal data center guidelines and standards such as ASHRAE and NEBS.</p>
        <p>For more information on RCI, ASHRAE/NEBS thermal guidelines, data center efficiency, refer to the following PDF deck: <a href="http://www.ancis.us/images/Herrlin_LABS21_Slides_09-18-2008_for_WEB_Compatibility_Mode_.pdf">http://www.ancis.us/images/Herrlin_LABS21_Slides_09-18-2008_for_WEB_Compatibility_Mode_.<MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-05-18T15:36:41.0842967-05:00" MadCap:creator="DSFoxx" MadCap:initials="DSF" MadCap:comment="update link or remove; there must be something more current than 2008!"

        <p>Performance metrics are important because they show conformance, allow real-time performance evaluation, enable benchmarking, and provide a means for measuring improvement. The RCI and RTI metrics were developed by ANCIS Incorporated in an effort to reduce the costs associated with cooling data centers. Large collections of highly utilized enterprise computing equipment generate a lot of heat. The most effective and easiest metric of the two is the RCI. This document is focused on deploying an <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> environmental monitoring solution that enables the measurement, computation, monitoring, and reporting of RCI values.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Rack Cooling Index (RCI) is a measure of compliance. Ideal compliance is 100%, but ANCIS suggests that a Good rating is ≥ 96%, an Acceptable rating is 91-95%, and a Poor rating is ≤90%.</li>
            <li>RCI can be computed for individual racks, rows of racks, any subsection of the data center (for example, pods), or for the entire data center.</li>
            <li>RCI is divided into RCI-HI and RCI-LO. The former is a measure of how many measure points are over temperature and the latter is a measure of how many points are under temperature. Enterprise computing equipment generates a lot of heat and there are substantial costs involved with keeping it operating at an optimal temperature. Therefore, the RCI-HI metric is really the key measurement. If data center resources become dangerously hot, then they are subject to malfunction and damage, but RCI is intended as a means to save money by reducing cooling costs so RCI-LO values are rarely “violated.” If they are, then data center management is paying too much for cooling.</li>
            <li>The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends maintaining rack intake temperatures in the range of 68°F - 77°F (20°C-25°C).</li>
