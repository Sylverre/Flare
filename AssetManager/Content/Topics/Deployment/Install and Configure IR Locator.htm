        <h2>Asset Auditing with IR-Enabled&#160;Tags and IR Locators</h2>
        <p>The A740 Rack Locator is designed for use in both open and closed rack environments. Each Rack Locator transmits an infrared (IR) pulse pattern containing a unique four-digit location code. The intensity of the IR transmissions can be adjusted to achieve complete coverage for open or closed racks with minimal bleed-over to adjacent racks.</p>
        <p>IR-enabled tags will detect incoming IR signals and periodically transmit the tag’s unique ID and a current IR location code. Tag transmissions are processed in real-time to quickly locate and identify tagged assets with rack-level accuracy.</p>
        <p>A750 Room Locators are used to cover larger areas or rooms such as receiving and staging areas. In a typical installation that utilizes both <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Rack and Room Locators, assets can be managed during their complete life cycle.</p>
        <p>Room Locators have a typical transmission radius of 35 feet or more. The IR transmissions occur within line-of-sight and by reflection effectively flooding the coverage zone with the room location code. It is important that Room Locators are not installed directly in areas where the Rack Locators are being used, since a Room Locator will overpower the IR transmissions of a Rack Locator.  IR coverage zones are limited by solid structures, so Room Locators should be used only when there are physical walls between the Room and Rack Locators.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When deploying locators and IR-enabled tags, it is possible that other IR sources can interfere with the locators’ IR transmissions. If an interference occurs, the IR tag may not be able to successfully decode the IR signal. This will cause the tag to report a payload indicating that it does not detect a valid signal. The tag’s RF signal will not be effected by any IR interference, however the IR location code will not be received. To avoid any IR interference refer to the following notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IR-enabled active tags are not designed to work outdoors. In direct sunlight, the IR tags will not detect the IR&#160;Locator transmissions.</li>
            <li>Do not cover the IR sensor on the tag label. This will affect the ability of the tag to read IR signals.</li>
            <li>The placement of tags within a room can affect the ability of the tag to decode infrared signals. Where possible tags should be placed so that their IR sensor would typically be facing towards an IR device, or have an unobstructed view of a surface, such as a wall, that will be illuminated by an IR&#160;device.</li>
            <li>For tags in general, the RF field of the tags are affected by large metal surfaces. Users should take caution when placing tags directly on metal surfaces that are large relative to the tag. This can cause a diminished read-range in some cases.</li>
        </ul>
