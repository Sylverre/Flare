        <h1>The Return Temperature Index (RTI)</h1>
        <p>The Return Temperature Index quantifies the energy performance of the air-management system. It is a measure of net by-pass air or net recirculation air in the equipment room. This metric and the formula for calculating it are included in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> in the default schema. You need only to select it for use when you configure <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and real-time values will be available for you to monitor after you deploy the physical infrastructure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is the ratio of total equipment airflow to total air-handler airflow expressed as a percentage.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>100% indicates balanced airflow (Target Airflow)</li><li>&lt; 100% indicates net airflow by-pass (Poor Net Airflow:&#160;By-Pass)</li><li>&gt; 100% indicates net airflow re-circulation (Poor Net Airflow:&#160;Recirculation)</li></ul></li>
            <li>If the cold supply air returns directly to CRACs without cooling the IT equipment, then power consumption by the fan increases and the efficiency of the chiller decreases.</li>
            <li>If hot exhaust from IT equipment is drawn back into intakes, then thermal hotspots are created and concern for equipment reliability is raised. This also results often in low RCI-HI values.</li>
            <li>Typically, when more air is delivered by the CRACs than is drawn into the electronic equipment, then this is due to net by-pass air.</li>
            <li>Poor air management drives over-provisioning the airflow, while hotspots often dictate the need for extra air.</li>
