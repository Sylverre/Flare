        <h1>Overview of a Pilot Deployment</h1>
        <p>Before installing hardware throughout your environment, begin with a pilot deployment. A pilot is typically a single-site test performed on a representative sample region within your data center.  This small deployment provides the opportunity to test functionality, gain experience, and pinpoint any areas of concern prior to the full roll-out.</p>
        <p style="page-break-after: avoid;">A pilot deployment can be approached in stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Assess your environment (or review the assessment done prior to <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-05-19T16:09:51.2992518-05:00" MadCap:creator="DSFoxx" MadCap:initials="DSF" MadCap:comment="still not fond of this phrasing" MadCap:editor="DSFoxx" MadCap:editDate="2015-05-19T16:09:56.2005322-05:00">purchase)</MadCap:annotation>.  </li>
            <li>Install <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for a pilot deployment.</li>
            <li>Configure IR&#160;Locators and <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-06-19T10:35:07.0731876-05:00" MadCap:creator="Pappillon" MadCap:initials="PA" MadCap:comment="061815 review, Frank switched the order of install and configure Locators/readers, since technically CS can be used as &quot;since, technically, our hardware is not required anymore (can be used as a standalone poor-man's DCiM)&quot;.  So do I need to import that footnote about other people's hardware, or add an &quot;if using&quot; statement, or is this okay?" MadCap:editor="Pappillon" MadCap:editDate="2015-06-19T10:36:09.7007697-05:00">readers.</MadCap:annotation></li>
            <li>Deploy readers, tags, and IR&#160;Locators.</li>
            <li>Add assets to pilot installation of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to prove data collection.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">
                <p>Assess pilot performance, and adjust plans for roll-out accordingly.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A full roll-out of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is quite similar in terms of hardware, but differs in software installation and configuration.  For a full roll-out, a database must be created, additional Zone Managers may be required depending on <a href="../Deployment Configuration.htm">deployment configuration</a>, assets must be tagged, and information loaded into the system.  System Administration tasks such as User Access setting are not typically addressed during a pilot, but must be completed before <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is made available to end users.</p>
