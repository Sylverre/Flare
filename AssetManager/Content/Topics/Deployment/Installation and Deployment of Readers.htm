        <h2>Installing Readers</h2>
        <p>To prepare the reader for installation, follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Attach a power source to the M250 Reader (AC power brick, DC power, or Power over Ethernet (PoE) cable).</li>
            <li>Attach an Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port of the M250 Reader and to an available network port on the switch.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> For initial configuration, the M250 Reader must be attached to a network port that is on the same subnet as the PC that you are using to connect to the M250 Reader.</p>
        <h2>Positioning Readers</h2>
        <p>When mounting your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> reader(s), follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ideally, readers should be hung from the ceiling (mounted with screws, holding clips, etc.) above a row of server racks with the antennas directed parallel to the row and at a 90 degree angle from one another. In general, the higher the ceiling, the better the read range. Considering a reader range, the reader should be placed as near as possible to the center of a circle with a 25-foot radius within which your sensor tags will be deployed.</li>
            <li>Most data center deployments use Power over Ethernet (PoE) and therefore require available and accessible Ethernet connections.</li>
            <li>Before mounting readers, be sure that they are configured properly.<br />For more information, visit <a href="http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/695441-reader-deployment-guidelines">support.rfcode.com</a></li>
