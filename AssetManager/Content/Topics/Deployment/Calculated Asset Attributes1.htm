            </a>Calculated Asset Attributes Overview</h3>
        <p>Calculated Asset Attributes can be used in Asset Manager in the same way as standard asset and status attributes. They can be used with Reports, Graphs, and Alerts and also can be viewed immediately on screen. The following types of calculated asset attributes are supported:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Boolean </li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Date</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Floating Point</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Integer</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Time and Date</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">String</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Calculated Attribute Formula must be created in order to configure a Calculated Asset Attribute. The following are components of a Calculated Attribute Formula:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Functions:</span>  These are built-in functions that are part of the Asset Manager software that are used to compute the calculated fields.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Attributes:</span>  These are the system or asset attributes which will be used to calculate the Calculated Asset Attribute.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Standard Mathematical Operators:</span>  These are the various operators that will be used within the formula such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, etc.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Scope:</span>  This is the field of reference or view of the calculated attribute. For example, local scope or location scope.</li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Time References:</span>  These are the time specifications that will be used in the Calculated Asset Attribute.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_44">Example: [ ASSET_COST * .25 ]<br /><br />The formula above produces a result which is 25% of the cost of the asset.</p>
