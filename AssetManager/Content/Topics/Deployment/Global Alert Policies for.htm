            </a>Global Alert Policies for Alert Actions and Thresholds</h2>
        <p>This sub-task lets you manipulate Alert Actions and Thresholds globally for the entire Asset Manager system. There are three Global Alert Policy settings that can be set:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Active:</span> when this setting is chosen, all alert actions and thresholds that have been configured in the Asset Manager system will be active and perform as configured.<br /></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Suspend Alert Actions:</span> when this setting is selected, all alert actions will be suspended until the “Active” global alert policy is re-selected. This will suspend all alert actions from being triggered until the setting is returned to “Active”.<br /></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">
                <span class="Strong">Suspend Thresholds &amp; Alert Actions:</span> when this setting is selected, all configured thresholds and alert actions will be suspended until the “Active” (or if Suspend Alert Actions is set, Threshold will be restored globally) global alert policy is re-selected. This stops thresholds in the system from functioning or alerts from happening. When the Active setting is restored, the thresholds and alert actions that occur from that moment on, will resume.</li>
        </ul>
