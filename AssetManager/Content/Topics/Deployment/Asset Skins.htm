        <p MadCap:conditions="General.notes for reviewers" style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">New for DCM! Added for Visualization? Probably. Need to determine if these are pre-installed, though it seems likely.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.New text">Default skins are provided for use in Vizualization. [xref] Custom Asset Skins can be created, if desired, from this view. Click New and complete each section (as always, fields marked with a red asterisk are required). Users can upload images for use as front and rear skins, and restrict use of custom skins to specified user groups.</p>
