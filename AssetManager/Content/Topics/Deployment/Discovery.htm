        <h1 MadCap:conditions="Default.SysManual">Discovery</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText" style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;">To discover your data center’s monitoring and asset management requirements, begin with an accurate assessment of your organization’s needs and resources, including each data center’s equipment population, the site infrastructure, security concerns and resources.  A site survey and physical inventory will reveal the best locations for readers and sensors and the necessary numbers and types of asset tags.  </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.NewText">Using the building plans you provide, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> develops reader placement diagrams. (These drawings show reader range as overlapping circles.) Readers are generally placed in each cold aisle, storage room, and dock area, with access to PoE or another power source, in such fashion as to ensure full coverage.  IR&#160;Locators are placed with access to power and clear sight-lines.</p>
        <p>For a pilot deployment, choose a representative area or areas on a single property.  Note whether an area is subject to extreme environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, dust, or moisture.</p>
        <p>In addition to an inventory and site survey, the discovery process includes considering the following items:</p>
        <h2>Site Access and Contact Information</h2>
        <p>Contact information for key decision-makers and on-site personnel who are critical to the successful completion of the site survey and pilot implementation. This list includes, but is not limited to personnel in the following roles: facility managers, IT managers, project managers, security, and business process owners. Also, access to a given area may be restricted or require security escorts, so make such necessary arrangements in advance of both the pilot and full roll-out deployments.</p>
        <h2>Network, Power, and General Environmental Considerations</h2>
        <p>Floor plans, wiring diagrams, and other visual representations of the areas where you will be deploying readers, sensors, and locators greatly assist in planning and deployment. If possible, locate and use scaled floor drawings with dimensions showing existing network and power drops. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Layouts saved as graphic files can be uploaded to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for use as maps.   You can map the sensors you install and view conditions such as temperature readings across your data center and which areas meet or do not meet the ASHRAE guidelines for <a href="http://www.rfcode.com/data-driven-data-center/bid/232990/Data-Center-Efficiency-The-Benefits-of-RCI-RTI-Part-1-of-3">RCI and RTI compliance</a>.</p>
        <h2>Network Topology and Security</h2>
        <p>Since <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> readers will be transmitting tag data over your IP network to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, network topology is a key consideration. IT staff should be consulted about policies and procedures for putting a reader on an IP network to ensure connectivity to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server. Established security measures such as firewalls may prevent the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server from receiving data through the default ports and settings.  </p>
