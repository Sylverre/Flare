            </a>Integrating with LDAP / Active Directory</h2>
        <p class="p_8">The following instructions will help you to configure Asset Manager to connect to an Active Directory or other LDAP server running on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012.</p>

            <span class="span_5">NOTE</span>
            <span class="span_2">:&#160; As of Asset Manager v2.8, access to Asset Manager can now be granted based on LDAP Group membership.&#160; This means that users that have never logged into Asset Manager can do so without an Admin explicitly creating a User account.&#160; Instead, an Administrator can grant access to Asset Manager to an entire LDAP User Group, e.g. Asset Managers.&#160; Thus a new employee to the company can be granted membership to that User Group and therefore be granted login rights based solely on Group membership without any additional administration needed within Asset Manager.&#160;&#160; This lightens the load for the Asset Manager system Administrator, especially for installations with a very large User population. </span>
