        <h1>Dashboards</h1>
        <p>Dashboards give you an easy way to monitor the data center by providing a visual representation of important information at a glance through the use of dials, meters, and or other Dashboard widget types that you configure.</p>
        <h2>Creating a Dashboard</h2>
        <p>To create a Dashboard, perform the following steps:</p>
        <p>1. Navigate to the User Console &gt; Dashboards Task and select the New button.</p>
        <p>The Create: User Dashboard settings box will appear prompting a required Name field and optional sizing specifications.</p>
        <p>2. Enter the required information and configure the general Dashboard settings (Name: is the only required information)</p>
        <p>3. Click the OK button to save.</p>
        <p>You will now see the new Dashboard on the left, a Widgets/Layout pane to the right of that, and the main Dashboard Preview pane to the right of the Widgets/Layout pane.</p>
        <p>4. From the Widget/Layout pane, select the Widget you want to use, e.g., a Dial.</p>
        <p>5. Drag the widget to the Dashboard Preview Pane</p>
        <p>A Widgets Settings pane appears.</p>
        <p>6. Configure the widget to show the Total Rack Cooling Index (HI) value for the entire data center (e.g., Austin Data Center)</p>
        <p>7. Chose the color, borders, title, fonts, etc. for the appearance of your widget.</p>
        <p>8. Click the Save Changes button to save the settings.</p>
        <p>9. Go to the dashboard preview pane to view the widget(s).</p>
        <p>NOTE: To adjust the spacing around the widgets, “blank” widgets can be added below and to the right of the widget to allow for re-sizing of the widget.</p>
