        <p>The Events task lets you set conditions that spawn notifications about conditions within Asset Manager. When information changes in a way that satisfies these conditions, the Events sub-system sends a notification to Users or to applications outside of Asset Manager that have been configured to receive them. Events do not need to have a beginning and end for notifications; instead, Events use Triggers that cause notifications to be sent. </p>
        <p>All Events have two basic components: Event Actions and Event Triggers.</p>
