Definitely belongs in Deployment, but I think I need expert guidance before I&#160;write the text. Placeholder screenshot and slightly tongue-in-cheek text for now...\r\nFound text in unreleased doc Zone Manager User Manual (beta) that describes this function in great detail, and it matches--to some degree--what Wilfred said happens. At my request, he sent samples of files received from and sent to a new client, and those files do include a configuration CSV designed for thumb drive, and a separate equipment config csv that will be uploaded via the web console, as displayed here.

        <p MadCap:conditions="General.New text">Migration made simple! Save your system configuration file, then upload to your new <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Also available for Tag Group Configuration, Reader Configuration, Location Configuration, and Rule Configuration.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.New text">Text approach should probably be: avoid duplicate data entry!&#160;Format your pre-sales inventory (device detail) spreadsheet as CSV, then upload it. As with other such files, schema import should come first. Best practice para ID’s in RFC-Comprehensive project, I think from Zone Manager (Beta), specifically addresses the use of leading 0s.</p>
