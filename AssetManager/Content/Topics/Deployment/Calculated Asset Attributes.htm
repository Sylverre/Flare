            </a>Calculated Asset Attributes</h2>
        <p>Calculated Asset Attributes are attributes that are derived from computations requiring data from other attributes. </p>
        <p>Three common uses of Calculated Asset Attributes are:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">To calculate a new Attribute for an Asset from an existing Attribute on the same Asset, e.g., a warranty expiration date calculated as a difference from asset purchase date<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">To calculate one Attribute for an asset from an Attribute that already exists on a different asset, e.g., the average temperature of a group of assets that involves aggregating the total temperature reported by a group of sensor tags <br /></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">To calculate an attribute for an asset from a number of attributes from various assets in a specific location</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ColorfulListAccent11">Example: Compute the maximum or average temperature for all sensor tags in a location</p>
