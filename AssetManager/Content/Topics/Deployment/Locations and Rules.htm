        <p>Assigning various rules to locations can help to fine tune the interpretation of tag location through the specification of reader channel SSI thresholds or through the use of IR Codes (if you use IR tags and Room Locators or Rack Locators).</p>
        <p>To add a Rule to a Location, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_3">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Select a location from the Location Hierarchy.<br /></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Click the <span class="Strong">New Rule</span> button.<br /></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">From the drop-down list, select the type of rule you would like to add.<br /><br /><span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; When the Match by IR Locator Rule is selected, a field titled Zone Manager will appear in the Rule Configuration box. The administrator is now able to specify which particular Zone Manager the rule applies to. This allows the administrator to duplicate IR Locator Numbers for different Zone Managers and causes the selected rule to be only applied when the specific IR Location Number is seen on the specified Zone Manager. The administrator will be able to choose from any of the Zone Managers that have been configured.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_44">
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; IR-based rules “trump” everything, i.e., they prevent rules based on signal strength indicators (SSI) from pulling assets out of an IR-defined Location.</p>
        <ol start="4" class="ol_3">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Fill in the required fields and click <span class="Strong">Save Changes</span>. <br />The rule should now appear in the Locations &amp; Rules tree under the location you have just applied the rule to.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Channels of a reader will show up in the left panel only when a reader’s Zone Manager (configured in Reader Configuration) is online.</p>
