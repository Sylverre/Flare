        <h1>Consoles</h1>
        <p>There are two primary views (consoles) in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, accessible at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Admin Console: Access this console by clicking the <b>Admin Console</b> link in the lower right corner of the web interface of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This console is typically used for administrative functions of the server and where a large portion of this document focuses.This is where most of the initial configuration is done.</li>
            <li>User Console: Access this console by clicking the <b>User Console</b> link in the lower right corner of the web interface of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This console is for managing and viewing sensors, alerts, dashboards, reports, graphs, etc. This is where the final configuration and daily use of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is done.<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Switching between the two consoles is done by clicking either the Admin Console or the User Console link at the bottom right of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user interface. The two links toggle depending on which console you are using.</p>

So conditioned out here, not sure where else it appears in each build.  Something to check!"
