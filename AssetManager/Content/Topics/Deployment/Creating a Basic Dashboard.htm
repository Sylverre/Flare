            </a>Creating a Basic Dashboard</h3>
        <p>To create a basic Dashboard, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_4">
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Navigate to the <span class="Strong">Dashboards </span>Task in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Administrator console. <br /></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">Notice that there is a default dashboard configured titled <span class="Strong">System Status</span>. <br /></li>
            <li class="ColorfulListAccent11">To create a new dashboard, click on the <span class="Strong">New </span>button. <br />A settings box will appear prompting a required Name field and sizing specifications. <br /><br /><img src="../../../../RFC-AM Comprehensive/Content/Resources/Images/UserManual for reference/020000C5.jpg" style="height: 357px;width: 211px;" class="img_2" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>After you have entered the required information and configured the general Dashboard settings and/or optionally configured the Groups function (see <span class="span_31">Security </span>section of this document for more information) for this dashboard, click the <span class="Strong">OK </span>button to save. <br /><br />You will now see the main dashboard customization panes. </p>
        <p class="p_83">There are three main areas, the widget/layout selection pane, the dashboard preview pane and the widget settings pane.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="Strong">&#160;&#160; Widgets/Layouts Selection Pane</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="Strong">&#160;&#160; Widget Settings Pane</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="Strong">&#160;&#160; Dashboard Preview Pane</span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_10">In order to begin customization of the dashboard you should first select the Layout type you would like to use. This is done by selecting the <span class="Strong">Blank </span>layout or the <span class="Strong">Table </span>layout from the Layout tree and dragging and dropping it onto the dashboard preview pane.</p>
        <p class="p_10">Select <span class="Strong">Blank</span> or <span class="Strong">Table</span> and drag to Dashboard Preview Pane</p>
        <p>
            <span class="Strong">Blank: </span> Choosing this layout option and dragging it to the Dashboard Preview Pane will place a “blank box” as the layout for the dashboard. The borders of this box can be manipulated by dragging the edges along the width or the height. More than one Blank box can be placed on the Dashboard. Multiple widgets can be placed in one Blank layout box. Blank layout boxes can also be used to create borders or blank spaces in the dash- board as well. A Blank layout box can be removed from the Dashboard Preview Pane by right-clicking and selecting <span class="Strong">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_10">
            <span class="Strong">Table </span>- Choosing this layout option and dragging it to the Dashboard Preview Pane will prompt a Grid Row/ Columns box where the number of rows and columns for the table will be selected. Once the number of row/ columns desired are entered, a blank table will appear in the Dashboard Preview Pane. The borders of this table can be manipulated by dragging the edges along the width or the height. More than one table can be placed in a Dashboard and tables can be placed within cells of another Table in the Dashboard. A table can be removed from the Dashboard by right-clicking and selecting the <span class="Strong">Delete table </span>option.</p>
        <p>Once you have selected a preferred Layout type, you will select a Widget type or multiple widget types that you would like to use in the creation of your Dashboard. There are fifteen widget types available (outlined in the table above). To configure your custom Dashboard with widgets, select the widget(s) desired from the Widgets/Layouts tree and drag it (or them) to the Dashboard Preview Pane.</p>
        <p>When you drag a widget to the Dashboard Preview Pane, you will see a Widgets Settings pane appear. It is here that you will configure the widget to use the Attributes of the Asset(s) that you desire to display in your custom dashboard. For each widget you can configure the visual display features such as color, borders, title, fonts, etc. When you have the widget settings configured, click the <span class="Strong">Save Changes </span>button to save the settings. </p>
        <p>Add as many or as few of the widgets that you desire to create your customized Dashboard.</p>
        <p class="p_44">
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>:&#160; The table views of the dashboard can be customized to display or not display specific columns in the table views either through configuring with the widget settings or through the process described in the following. To hide any of these columns, click on the right-side of the column where a menu arrow will appear. Scroll down to the Columns item and uncheck any of the columns that you would like to hide. You can also sort these columns in ascending or descending order alphabetically. The preferences that you establish for the setup of your table views and dashboard configuration are automatically saved and will appear in the manner you have established each time you login.</p>
