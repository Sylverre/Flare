        <h1>Inventory Spreadsheet</h1>
        <p>If you completed an inventory during your site assessment (pre-purchase) process, use that inventory as a data source for importing into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Otherwise, divide your site into zones and list all assets within each zone in a spreadsheet. For each asset, record information to be included in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. </p>
        <p>What information you collect depends on your needs. Commonly collected information includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asset Name</li>
            <li>Asset Type</li>
            <li>Asset Description</li>
            <li>Manufacturer</li>
            <li>Model </li>
            <li>Serial Number</li>
            <li>Mount Type</li>
            <li>Purchase Date</li>
            <li>Location, current<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A sample inventory spreadsheet can be downloaded from <a href="http://support.rfcode.com/">support.rfcode.com</a> </p>
        <p>To import assets, you must first export a CSV file, then populate it (fill in its cells) and import back to the system.  The CSV file will have seven columns, but only two of these <i>must</i> be completed: the assetʼs Name ($aName) and the assigned Asset Tag ($aAssetTag).  Both of these must be unique; duplicates will not be imported. Other columns may be completed if the information is available.</p>
