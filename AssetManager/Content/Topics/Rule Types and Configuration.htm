        <p>
            <span class="Strong">NOTE</span>: Almost without exception, you will choose one of the first two Rules, either <span class="Strong">Match by Simple SSI</span> or <span class="Strong">Match by IR Locator</span>.&#160; If neither of these Rules seems to be working for whatever reason, please contact RF Code Support for assistance before adding one of the other Rules to the Location Hierarchy.</p>
