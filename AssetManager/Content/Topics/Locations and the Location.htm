        <p class="p_6">Locations in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> represent the physical locations of the assets you are tracking or monitoring. The Location Hierarchy reflects the physical locations in your organization or area of deployment.&#160; The default Location Hierarchy is unpopulated.</p>

        <p class="p_6">After defining your location hierarchy, you can then associate rules to specific locations in the hierarchy in order to determine which tag and therefore which asset is in which location.&#160; By doing this, you can also associate the asset locations to a custom map in order to provide a visual representation of your assets and sensor data. Correctly configuring the location hierarchy requires careful planning.&#160; While the hierarchy and individual locations can be edited, the process of creating rules and associating assets to the individual levels in the hierarchy is one that takes some time and effort to undo. </p>
        <p class="p_10">
            <span class="span_2">When you associate locations (or “zones”) to your reader(s), the system can then, with the assistance of the Zone Manager(s), interpret tag location data dynamically. Assigning various rules to locations can help to fine tune the interpretation of tag location through the specification of reader channels and SSI threshold settings.

            <span class="span_5">NOTE</span>
            <span class="span_2">: Location names must be unique so it is common practice to string Location “level” names together in order to uniquely identify each Location, especially at the most granular layers.&#160; For example, most data centers have multiple rows of server racks; therefore, simply naming a Location Rack 1, even though it might exist under two different row layers (e.g., Row 1 and Row 2), it is necessary to distinguish the two distinct Rack 1 layers in a manner such as: Rack 01-01 and Rack 01-02.</span>
