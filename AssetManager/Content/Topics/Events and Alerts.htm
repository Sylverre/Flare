        <h1>System Notifications:&#160;Events and Alerts</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can notify users or outside systems whenever certain conditions are met.  Administrators can configure Event and Alert notifications about states of the  system, which includes  hardware used to monitor it. Users with the appropriate permissions can create Event and Alert notifications about the state of the assets being managed and the environment being monitored.</p>
        <p>Alerts use a set condition and clear condition, and an alert remains active until the clear condition is met.  Events have defined triggers, and an event occurs each time the trigger condition is met.  Events might be used to send data from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to other software systems or to notify users when certain conditions occur, while the Alerts are configured to ensure that you know the location of your assets, their operational state, and conditions of the environment in which they are being used.</p>
        <p>Both events and alerts perform an assigned Action when conditions are met. Event and Alert Actions include sending email, posting messages via HTTP, writing notification messages to logs, etc. Alerts can also be sent to Serial Devices.</p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Alerts for asset status and environmental conditions are set using the User Console. These conditions include Asset Offline, Differential Pressure, Door Open and Close, Fluid Detected, Humidity, Low Battery, Motion, Tamper, and Temperature conditions, plus Custom and Adaptive Alerts set by the user. The Admin Console is used to configure Alert condition filters for Reader conditions (high traffic, noise, offline, tag capacity) and Zone Manager conditions (offline).&#160; From the Admin Console, you can also set a Global Alert Policy that affects all alerts for all users.</p>
