        <p>Asset attributes define fields to hold specific pieces of information about assets. Administrators may define as many asset attributes as needed to properly represent the various assets to be managed. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> supports a variety of different types of attributes.&#160; </p>
        <p>There are three main categories of Attributes: Asset Attributes, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">Status </MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Logan">System </MadCap:conditionalText>Attributes, and Calculated Asset Attributes. The second two “types” of Attributes are the Status Attribute and the Calculated Asset Attribute.&#160; The first is a group of pre-defined attributes that cannot be changed.&#160; The second, Calculated Asset Attributes, are created and defined with formulas to create dynamic alerting and reporting features within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and are a key component to Summary Assets.&#160; The two special classes of attributes, as well as Summary Assets, are covered in separate sections of this document.</p>
        <p>The first type of attribute is the main type of Asset Attribute.&#160; These can be created and assigned to Asset Types. </p>
