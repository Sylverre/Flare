I think it's easier than Hot Spots, so place this first for now." MadCap:editor="DSFoxx" MadCap:editDate="2015-05-08T10:27:33.4944132-05:00">Points</MadCap:annotation></h1>
        <p>A reference point has the same functionality as a drawn hot spot to display information or to link to a location, asset or URL, but does not require a hot spot shape to be drawn. This tool could be useful for display of information that you might want to single out within a hot spot shape that has been drawn. For example, a reference point can be placed that creates a hot spot for a temperature sensor asset within the location hot spot. This reference point will then display the information for that temperature sensor on the map.</p>
        <h2>Placing a Reference Point</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To place a reference point, click the <span class="Strong">Place Reference Point</span> tool . Place your pointer where you would like to place the reference point on the map and click once. A reference point box will appear.</li>
            <li>
                <p>2. Select a Hot Spot Target for the reference point. In this example, the target for the reference point is selected to be an asset. Then select the asset (or location or URL) for the reference point and click the <span class="Strong">Save Changes</span> button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once you have saved the reference point you can move the information box around on the map. This can be done by clicking on the Select &amp; Edit tool and then by clicking on and dragging the information box. To move the reference point itself, place the pointer over the reference point outline box and the pointer will change to a hand. Grab and drag the reference point box to your desired location. When finished, click the Save Changes button.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Drawing a Map Attributes Box</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1. A Map Attributes Box can be used to display various attributes about the map you are creating. To place a map attributes box, select the Draw Map Attributes Box tool , place the pointer in an area where you would like to place the box on the map and click and drag the box to the desired size.<br /><br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>To move or resize the map attributes box, click the Select &amp; Edit tool and click on the box. To move the box click and drag it to the desired position on the map. To resize the box, click on one of the reference points in the corners of the box and resize. When finished, click the Save Changes button.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The map attributes box will resize in proportion with the image when being viewed.</p>
