            <li>If you are going to connect the reader to a GPS device, select <span class="Strong">Reader GPS</span> to enable it to report its GPS coordinates and to filter GPS data. Doing so will present you with additional fields related to configuring GPS settings.<br /></li>

        <h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">SSI Change Threshold: </span> &lt;min-ssi-change&gt; is a parameter that allows messages that report small Signal Strength Indicator (SSI) value changes to be treated as “unchanged”. Any message where all the SSI values reported are &lt;min-ssi-change&gt; or less dBm different from the previously reported message will be considered to have not changed.&#160; The default value is 3. <br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">SSI Cutoff (Channel A, B): </span> Sets the channel SSI threshold to the respective dBm (fixed threshold value).&#160; RF Code reader limitation is 41 to 115 dB.&#160; This feature is used to reduce the effective read range of a reader.&#160; For example, entering a value of 68 for channel A and B will cause tags that are read at -68dB or less to not be reported. In general, tags that are further away from a reader have lower SSI values. <br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Tag Age-Out Time: </span> is the number of seconds since the last successful message read from a tag before the tag is considered “lost.” The allowed values range from 10 to 32767. The default value is 60 seconds. If the value is set to 0, the tag timeout is infinite. A tag that has not been seen by a reader for “n” seconds will be reported as not present. <br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Tag Age-Out Time (Channel A, B): </span> This field functions the same as Tag Age-Out Time, but is Channel specific. <br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Tag Age-Out Time (Reader Offline): </span> Is the length of time to keep tags in the system if a reader goes offline. “n” seconds after a reader goes offline the tags that had been reported by this reader will be reported as offline. <br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Tag Age-In Count: </span> is an optional parameter used to tell the reader to not report messages from a tag until “n” messages have been received from that tag. This allows the option of ignoring tags that may appear for a short period of time (for example, due to a tag isolation box being opened for a few seconds). <br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Channel Bias (Channel A, B): </span> This setting allows for a compensation offset value to be added when different gain antennae are used. <br /></li>

        <h2>Reader Partitioning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Reader Partition Count: </span> This indicates the number of portions the tag ID range will be divided into. The value must be from 1 to 32, and must be greater than the Reader Partition Index. The default is 1.<br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Reader Partition Index: </span>This indicates which portion of the range of tag IDs the reader will observe (specifically, what the remainder must be when the tag ID is divided by the Reader Partition Count). The value must be from 0 to 31, and must be less than the Reader Partition Count. The default is 0. <br /></li>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Reader Partition Rotation Time: </span> This specifies the amount of time that the reader is reset to observe tag IDs of the next partition index. The default is 0, which will not reset the reader to observe tag IDs of the next partition index. <br />For additional in-depth information about Reader Partitioning, consult the following RF Code Support KB article: <a href="http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/846730">http://support.rfcode.com/customer/portal/articles/846730</a></li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Strong">Noise Threshold: </span> This is the threshold for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to send an alert for excessive RF noise in the system, as detected by the reader (“D” command for noise level). If the noise is excessive, the reader performance is compromised. 
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
